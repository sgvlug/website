    <p>In a talk called "Mapping Wireless Access Points," Peter J. Sprenger will talk 
about making a small toughbook into a Linux car navigation system. He also   <br />
enabled GPS integration to enhance wireless access point findings by combining 
GPS information with a Google map overlay and Kismet data dumps to map out   <br />
existing wireless access points.                                               </p>
<p>Sprenger has used Linux for the past 13 years. Currently running LFS as main <br />
desktop system, with a FreeBSD shell server and Slackware Media PC. He is    <br />
leads a Cal Poly team for CCDC (Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition),       <br />
concentrating in network defense. Special attention to security research and <br />
Information Warfare studies with experience in several different continents  <br />
performing missions occasionally oriented in that direction.                   </p>
