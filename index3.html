                <div class="entry-content"> <p><strong>This month, we are hosted by </strong><a href="http://newmatter.com">New Matter</a><strong>, a new
3D printing company incubated at Idealab</strong>.<strong>  Please <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SGVTech/events/234113164/">RSVP on Meetup</a> or email 
Lan (L dot Dang at ymail dot com). We'll head out to Du-Par's Restaurant
and Bakery (214 S Lake Ave, Pasadena) around 9:15pm for a late dinner.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Dave Flynn will share his extensive experience with 3D printing from the past
4 years, as well as his motivations for designing and building his own 3D
printer.  Specifically, his experience is with the RepRap style of 3D
printers.</p>
<p>The presentation will be short as Dave much prefers answering questions.</p>
<p>We welcome the 3D printing community--whether they are experts or neophytes--
to share the things they've printed and spark a conversation about what we can
do with 3D printing, how to get started, and how 3D printing can be used for
art, home, hobby, and work.</p>
<p>Please contact Lan if you are bringing something for show and tell or want to do a lightning talk.</p>

<p>Text is everywhere but not always in a useful form.  On any given day we
encounter dozens or hundreds of data formats.  Some formats are focused on
presentation while others focus on structure at the expense of presentation.
Many times the information we need has to be found, disentangled and
manipulated before it is useful.  The easier we can navigate across these
boundaries, the more freedom we have to find new uses and insights.</p>
<p>Linux offers a rich array of commands and tools for text processing at the
command line.  This talk proposes a classification for different types of
command line processing tasks and then explores some of the common tools
available within each category.  Many of these tools have a host of options.
Some useful but lesser known options will be highlighted.  The tools will then
be applied to a number of examples covering data extraction, processing and
presentation.</p>

<p>Joel Steres spends most of his time at the command prompt.  He is still amazed
at how small specialized building blocks can be combined to achieve big
results.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<p>What do amateur radio operators, small businesses, giant corporations, E911 
systems, and Linux hobbyists all have in common?</p>
<p>Well, besides using Linux, they all are using an application called Asterisk, 
in one of its many forms, to handle telecommunications.</p>
<p>Amateur radio operators can interlink plain old telephone systems with repeaters, 
small businesses can appear to the world to be a large corporation with custom 
interactive voice response menus, and hobbyists can lower their home phone bill 
to as little as a $1.00 per month with $0.0015/minute call charges.</p>
<p>Not to mention to have a phone number virtually anywhere in the world termin
ate at your home,</p>
<p>The presentation will introduce Asterisk, its applications, basic Python scripting, 
and many other things.</p>

England’s foremost, and third oldest, universities. His also holds undergraduate 
degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Physics as well as a 
Master of Science in Applied Mathematics. During the course of his career, he has 
worked for a “think tank” doing mathematical modeling, then the U.S. Navy, thins 
the senior civilian, and reserve, for one of the largest police departments in 
California. </p>
<p>Now he is a Professor of Computer Science at Pasadena City College. He holds and 
Extra Class amateur radio license and is very active within the hobby as well as 
integrating Linux and amateur radio into one cohesive unit. </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>This month, SGVLUG and InfoSec Syndicate member Ray S will give a brief
history on P2P software technology, applications and implementations.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<p>The P2P and the World of Tomorrow presentation will address a brief history on
the development on P2P software technology, applications and implementations
by the end user. Applications such as Audio Galaxy, Napster, Direct Connect,
Gnutella, Freenet, eDonkey2000, Kazaa, Morpheus, BitTorrent and Soulseek will
be discussed in the presentation. End user usage patterns based on net
cultural behavioral norms will be addressed as well as the development of
conflict as result of practicing such norms on a end user case-by-case basis.
Media attention and changes in policies of governance in relation to P2P
technology and usage are topics that will be touched on in the presentation.
New changes in P2P technology being made to maneuver difficulties that have
arisen from changes in governance policies are addressed later in the
presentation. The presentation's conclusion addresses technological
responsibility and safety practices the audience can use to prevent themselves
from becoming a marginalized end user as in the cases discussed earlier in the
presentation.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>Many good, experienced high-level language programmers do not learn C or C++
well until they suddenly need to write an FFI extension, make an emergency
patch to an existing C or C++ codebase, re-implement the bottleneck component
in the application stack in a fast language, take an attractive job with a
low-level programming component, or otherwise move from their comfortable
language of choice and swallow the Red Pill of coding closer to the machine.
If you are already a programmer, you don't need to be taught how to program,
and your google-fu is strong for looking up detailed syntax.  Instead, this
will be a crash course in leveraging skills you learned in a high-level
environment and transferring them to these low-level tools, acquiring some new
skills you simply never needed before, and a building a mental picture of
where the road to expert, idiomatic mastery lies.  We will focus on plain C
because C++ is too complex to cover well in a single talk, but much of the
material will apply directly to C++.  Perhaps surprisingly, some of  it will
even make you a better programmer in your favorite comfortable,  higher-level
language.</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
<p>Some little-known facts about Dustin Laurence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>His first exposure to computers was playing Colossal Cave<br />
Adventure and the bootleg Fortran IV version of Zork on his cousin's work
mainframe using a glass teletype and a modem with a cradle for the handset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His first good programming language was C.  He lies and pretends that C is where he learned to program because 8-bit BASIC is embarrassing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He once gave up trying to learn the libc low-level I/O functions from the Ultrix man pages because he thought a buffer must be some kind of abstract data type provided by the C library and he couldn't find any documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He once confidently predicted that Linux was a temporary fad that would be replaced by BSD for serious work once the Berkeley codebase was completely free.  It's probably a good thing he doesn't gamble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He avoids social media for the same reason he doesn't do crack cocaine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<p>OpenX is located in the One West Bank building @ 888 E Walnut St.  Pasadena CA, 91101. Entrances to the building are eastbound on Walnut, right hand side before the Lake St. intersection or southbound on Lake St. right hand side after the Walnut St. intersection. Once through the driveway, please park in the 888 Lot that has the OpenX logo displayed out front. Pull a ticket and bring it with you to the Meetup, we will validate your parking.</p>
