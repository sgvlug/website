    <p>Unity is the new desktop environment for Ubuntu, having first premiered in   <br />
version 11.04, significantly enhanced with version 11.10, and very much the  <br />
cornerstone of the upcoming 12.04 release.                                     </p>
<p>A striking departure from Gnome 2, Unity has been seen as a source of        <br />
controversy in the Linux world.                                                </p>
<p>This talk will outline some of the design goals that Unity addresses, noting <br />
strengths, weaknesses, and improvements across the three versions of Ubuntu in 
which it's been included.                                                      </p>
<p>While Unity offers many usability affordances, some Ubuntu users prefer to   <br />
customize it for their specific workflows. Linux is famous for its           <br />
customizability, and Unity is no exception if you know which tools to look   <br />
for.                                                                           </p>
<p>This presentation will outline some of the tools available through the Ubuntu<br />
Software Center to show you how to customize the Unity interface.              </p>
<p>Speaker Bio: Richard Gaskin is President of Fourth World, a software design  <br />

Congress, and hundreds of universities around the world.                       </p>
<p>Although he started his career with Mac OS, Richard has since delivered      <br />
applications for Irix, every version of Windows, and has been developing for <br />
Linux for the last two years.                                                  </p>
<p>Richard has spoken at more than a dozen tech conferences, including UbuCon,  <br />
