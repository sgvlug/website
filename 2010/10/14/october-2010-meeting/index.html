    <p>Filling the Digital Divide with Offline Content: Six ways to deliver a library 
anywhere for under $90                                                         </p>
<p>SUMMARY                                                                        </p>
<p>Off-line content is reading material, educational texts, and other reference <br />
materials delivered on media such as SDCards, DVDs, custom hardware, or hard <br />
drives so that it can be used without internet access. A typical deployment  <br />
can deliver the equivalent of tens of thousands of printed books. The cost to<br />
deliver large off-line libraries has fallen below the cost to deliver online <br />
internet access in most areas. Off-line content thus provides a cost effective 
way to provide access to the world's knowledge before affordable internet    <br />
infrastructure is available. This presentation reviews six emerging projects <br />
which aim to provide off-line hardware and libraries, including the author's <br />
creation, the $20 Humane Reader                                                </p>
<p>Braddock Gaskill is CEO and co-founder of Dockside Vision Inc, an advanced   <br />

founding Dockside Vision, Mr. Gaskill had over ten years of experience as a  <br />
technology consultant in both the defense and commercial sectors. His        <br />
expertise spans the fields of information visualization, collaborative       <br />
systems, electronics design, machine vision, information assurance, and      <br />
robotics control, and includes publications in ballistics simulation, a patent 
in crytographic authentication, and multiple pending patents in visualization<br />
techniques.                                                                    </p>
