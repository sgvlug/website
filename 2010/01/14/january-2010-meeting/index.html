    <p>A Case Study in Open Source Software Development                               </p>
<p>For three years the speaker ran a small technology startup company developing<br />
new ways of visualizing and exploring huge datasets, like, for example, the  <br />
entire routing structure of the internet, or tens of thousands of documents.   </p>
<p>This talk will cover real-world experiences with the broad variety of Open   <br />
Source software which made the project possible. Dependencies included Boost,<br />
CMake, OpenSceneGraph, khtml, gecko, Firefox plugins, GraphViz, lighttpd,    <br />
Xerces DOM, and more. Theses building blocks were in many cases pushed to (and 
beyond) their limits, deployed in a cross-platform Linux and Windows         <br />
environment, and compiled with GCC and MSVC++. We will cover lessons learned,<br />
better alternatives, and other findings.                                       </p>
<p>Braddock Gaskill is CEO and co-founder of Dockside Vision Inc, an advanced   <br />

founding Dockside Vision, Mr. Gaskill had over ten years of experience as a  <br />
technology consultant in both the defense and commercial sectors. His        <br />
expertise spans the fields of information visualization, collaborative       <br />
