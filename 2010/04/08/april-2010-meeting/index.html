    <p>Monthly meeting.                                                               </p>
<p>April 2010: An open-source 8-bit computer to save the world Braddock is back!  </p>
<p>Braddock Gaskill will discuss and debut his open source hardware and software<br />
project designed both for hobbyists and as an e-book reader for developing   <br />
nations.                                                                       </p>
<p>The device can store a 5,000 book library or the better part of Wikipedia and<br />
display it on any TV set in a developing-world village library - all for under 
$20. It is also a fun general purpose 8-bit computing platform comparable in <br />
raw capability to the Apple II and built, in part, for experimentation and   <br />
hobbyists. The entire system is open sourced, and uses GNU toolchain cross   <br />
development under Linux with heavy OSS throughout.                             </p>
<p>The presentation will work through the design, schematic, PCB fab, assembly, <br />
and software dev. Braddock will walk the audience through each stage, cover  <br />
which tools were used, ponder major design considerations, and pay special   <br />
attention to open source solutions.                                            </p>
<p>Date: Thursday April 8, 2010 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM                                 <br />
Location: Downs 107                                         </p>
