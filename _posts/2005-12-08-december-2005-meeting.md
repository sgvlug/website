Monthly meeting.                                                               
                                                                             
CinePaint is an open source software application primarily used for motion     
picture frame-by-frame retouching and dust-busting. Many films, such as Harry  
Potter and Spider-Man, use CinePaint. It was used by Flash Film Works to add   
flying arrows in The Last Samurai, work that helped them win a VES award for   
Best Supporting Effects. CinePaint is the most popular open source application 
in motion picture production.                                                  
                                                                             
CinePaint project leader Robin Rowe will talk about the new Glasgow            
architecture, what's implemented, and what remains to be done. CinePaint       
Glasgow is scheduled for release on December 31, 2005. Glasgow runs on Linux,  
Windows, and Mac OSX. Robin Rowe has led CinePaint since 2002. He's the
