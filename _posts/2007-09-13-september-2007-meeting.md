Kerry Garrison is back to demo the new trixbox Pro product from Fonality. This 
latest incarnation uses the hybrid-hosted model developed by Fonality for      
PBXtra, but gives installers the control over the hardware and phone           
provisioning that they enjoy with trixbox CE.                                  
                                                                             
Kerry Garrison has been in the IT industry for over 20 years with positions    
ranging from IT Director of a large multi-site distribution company to         
developing a large hosted web server platform for a major ISP, to running his  
own IT consulting business in Southern California. Kerry was introduced to the 
world of Asterisk by a friend and began installing Asterisk-based phone        
systems for his small business clients. He wrote articles about Asterisk and   
trixbox that became extremely popular on the net, and eventually published the 
definitive book on trixbox, "trixbox Made Easy." Today, Kerry is the senior

trade shows, user groups, and radio programs. He is also the publisher of both
