Wilfred Nilsen will present the BarracudaDrive, a secure Web application server 
for the Linksys NSLU2 (Network Storage Link for USB 2.0 Disk Drives) using the  
Unslung Linux firmware replacement. Using an external USB Flash memory for      
storing the database files, it should be possible to create an application      
server that is virtually maintenance free.                                      
                                                                              
Wilfred will be here to give a demo of the NSLU2 running BarracudaDrive,        
including the many practical features of BarracudaDrive and how some users use  
BarracudaDrive for many non traditional Web server tasks.
