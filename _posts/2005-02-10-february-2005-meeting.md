Mark Echeverri, who has years of experience in traditional software and        
systems engineering, says: "For the past couple of months, I've been working   
with Plone. It's an impressive system, and not exactly something you pick up   
in a Saturday. Previously, I had never done any Web-related development; Plone 
is a Zope tool that allows you to juggle Web portals like bowling              
pins...provided you know how to take advantage of it. Quite powerful."         
                                                                             
About Zope and Plone:                                                          
                                                                             
"Zope is an open source application server for building content management     
systems, intranets, portals, and custom applications....Zope is written in     
Python, a highly-productive, object-oriented scripting language."

"Plone is an out-of-the-box ready content management system that is built on   
the powerful and free Zope Application server. It requires minimal effort to   
set up, is deeply flexible, and provides you with a system for managing web    
content that is ideal for project groups, communities and intranets."
