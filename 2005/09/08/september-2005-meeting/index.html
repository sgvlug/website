    <p>Matt Ingenthron from Sun Microsystems will review Sun's involvement in the   <br />
various open source communities and talk a bit about the latest, greatest hunk 
of intellectual property Sun's released to the wild: OpenSolaris.              </p>
<p>Matt will discuss OpenSolaris's goals, how licensing works (and why you      <br />
shouldn't be afraid of it) and how to get involved. This meeting will also   <br />
cover what OpenSolaris is (and isn't) and have a brief demo. Take a look at  <br />
http://www.opensolaris.org/os/about/ before attending to develop your own    <br />
questions about the project.                                                   </p>
<p>Matt is a Technical Specialist for Sun Microsystems and supports a variety of<br />
customers across the Western US. Based in Los Angeles, Matt has worked with a<br />
number of customers on Linux and Solaris adoption and migration from other   <br />
platforms. Matt is part of the Web Services practice of the Client Solutions <br />
organization which specializes in use of Java Enterprise System software use <br />
by customers on both platforms.                                                </p>
<p>Date: Thursday September 8, 2005 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM                             <br />
Location: Downs 107                                         </p>
