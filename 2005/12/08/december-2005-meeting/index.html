    <p>Monthly meeting.                                                               </p>
<p>CinePaint is an open source software application primarily used for motion   <br />
picture frame-by-frame retouching and dust-busting. Many films, such as Harry<br />
Potter and Spider-Man, use CinePaint. It was used by Flash Film Works to add <br />
flying arrows in The Last Samurai, work that helped them win a VES award for <br />
Best Supporting Effects. CinePaint is the most popular open source application 
in motion picture production.                                                  </p>
<p>CinePaint project leader Robin Rowe will talk about the new Glasgow          <br />
architecture, what's implemented, and what remains to be done. CinePaint     <br />
Glasgow is scheduled for release on December 31, 2005. Glasgow runs on Linux,<br />
Windows, and Mac OSX. Robin Rowe has led CinePaint since 2002. He's the      <br />
founder of LinuxMovies.org. He's a partner in motion picture technology      <br />
company MovieEditor.com.                                                       </p>
