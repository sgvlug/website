    <p>Orv Beach has been messing with computers for over 20 years. His first       <br />
experience with computer operating systems was with CP/M, in the early '80s. <br />
His first Linux was Slackware, in 1996. Since then he's moved to Red Hat Linux 
and then Fedora Core. While not a programmer, he's actively involved in the  <br />
Linux community.                                                               </p>
<p>He's a principal member of the Simi-Conejo Linux Users Group, the Marketing  <br />
chair for the Linux Expo of Southern California, and is currently employed as<br />
the Information System Director at Simi Valley Hospital.                       </p>
<p>Orv will demonstrate various command line commands and utilities that are    <br />
useful for administering a Linux system. He'll throw in a few basic bash     <br />
tricks as a bonus.                                                             </p>
