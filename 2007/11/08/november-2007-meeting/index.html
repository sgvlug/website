    <p>Asterisk is an open-source PBX program that provides automatic call          <br />
distribution, voice mail and interactive voice response menus. X10 is a      <br />
power-line carrier protocol for controlling lights and appliances. What can  <br />
you do when you combine them? Claude Felizardo will give us an update on his <br />
home-automation system and how integrating Asterisk has moved his home closer<br />
to what is depicted in popular science fiction.                                </p>
<p>With over 15 years as a Unix developer, Claude got his start with Linux in the 
late 90s when he built his own firewall. Most of his friends and family think<br />
he has too many gadgets, but he's always looking for something new to play   <br />
with, especially if it can be integrated into his system at home. His previous 
presentations include an Intro to Home Automation, Hacking TiVo and Monitoring 
the Weather with Linux.                                                        </p>
