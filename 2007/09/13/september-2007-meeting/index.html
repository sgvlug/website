    <p>Kerry Garrison is back to demo the new trixbox Pro product from Fonality. This 
latest incarnation uses the hybrid-hosted model developed by Fonality for    <br />
PBXtra, but gives installers the control over the hardware and phone         <br />
provisioning that they enjoy with trixbox CE.                                  </p>
<p>Kerry Garrison has been in the IT industry for over 20 years with positions  <br />
ranging from IT Director of a large multi-site distribution company to       <br />
developing a large hosted web server platform for a major ISP, to running his<br />
own IT consulting business in Southern California. Kerry was introduced to the 
world of Asterisk by a friend and began installing Asterisk-based phone      <br />
systems for his small business clients. He wrote articles about Asterisk and <br />
trixbox that became extremely popular on the net, and eventually published the 
definitive book on trixbox, "trixbox Made Easy." Today, Kerry is the senior  <br />
product development manager for trixbox at Fonality. Kerry regularly speaks at 
trade shows, user groups, and radio programs. He is also the publisher of both 
http://www.voipspeak.net and http://www.asterisktutorials.com. Kerry is an   <br />
avid amateur photographer who writes tutorials and product reviews for his   <br />
photography blog site at http://L7Foto.com.                                    </p>
