    <p>Kris Bergstrom will give an introduction to the extremely powerful LaTeX     <br />
typesetting system and its application to real-world document production. He <br />
will explain how he uses it in the creation of essays, books, and letters    <br />
incorporating graphics. He will also demonstrate the use of LaTeX in his     <br />
band's annual fund drive which requires the creation of personalized letters <br />
(mail merge) and envelopes.                                                    </p>
<p>Initially designed to typeset mathematical formulae, the LaTeX system        <br />
incorporates world-class fonts with international symbols. The system        <br />
successfully handles the automatic typesetting of complicated textbooks with <br />
thousands of images and internal page, chapter, and figure references. The   <br />
line-breaking algorithm used by LaTeX (or more accurately, by the more basic <br />
TeX engine) is the industry leader (eventually adopted by Adobe for its      <br />
commercial program, InDesign).                                                 </p>
<p>About the presenter:                                                         <br />
Kris Bergstrom was first exposed to GNU/Linux in electronic music courses at <br />
Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. In 2000,     <br />
excited by the ideals of Free Software, he tried to switch his desktop from  <br />
Windows to Debian but with limited knowledge of networking and basic admin   <br />
tasks, was unable to get a basic system up and running. Soon after moving to <br />
Los Angeles in 2002, he joined a Linux Users Group and found the support he  <br />
needed to do all his personal and business computer tasks with free software.  </p>
