    <p>X509 and SSL are complicated topics. While they share the basic PKI          <br />
infrastructure that PGP and others do, X509 (and SSL by extension) are more  <br />
complicated. Extending beyond the basic encryption, signing, decryption, and <br />
verification of basic PKI, X509 includes a variety of extra pieces and       <br />
information enabling more features. This talk will cover what X509 and SSL   <br />
are, how they relate, how to use them, and how to learn more. It will discuss<br />
PKI from both an certificate end-user perspective as well as from a          <br />
Certificate Authority perspective. If time permits, a small comparison to PGP<br />
will also be included akin to the one at the end of my PGP talk.               </p>
