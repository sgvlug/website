  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The old saying goes that "everyone has a book inside of them", and advances in
technology have made publishing more accessible than ever. The opportunities
in traditional and independent publishing are wide open.  But writing a book
remains a daunting task, and new authors will encounter many steps along the
way.</p>
<p>What does it take to publish information in the digital age?  Hybrid author
Nathan Haines discusses working with traditional publishers that use
proprietary software and formats, and describes the self-publishing process
from start to finish.  From ebooks to print, is Free and Open Source Software
up to the task?</p>
