    <p>Ronald Stewart, creative director of the Trinity Audio Group will speak at the 
next San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group. He will present the                <br />
yet-to-be-released InDaMixx appliance, a full-featured, hand-held recording  <br />
studio built on Linux (a customized version of 64Studio, to be more specific). 
He will go over topics such as why Linux was chosen, the future of music in  <br />
the open-source community and will demo some of the great features of        <br />
InDaMixx.                                                                      </p>
<p>Ronald's background in the music industry goes back to the late 80's as a DJ &amp; 
Remixer for Factor 3 Records, Tommy Boy Records, Bullet Proof Records &amp; one of 
the first beta testers for Digidesign's Pro Tools. Ronald decided that he    <br />
needed a full-featured device that he could take with him, along with all his<br />
music only to find out nothing like this existed. Ever the frontiersman,     <br />
Ronald decided to blaze the trail, chose all open-source applications and    <br />
hasn't looked back ever since.                                                 </p>
<p>Date: Thursday March 13, 2008 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM                                <br />
Location: Downs 107                                         </p>
