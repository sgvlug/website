history on P2P software technology, applications and implementations.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<p>The P2P and the World of Tomorrow presentation will address a brief history on
the development on P2P software technology, applications and implementations
by the end user. Applications such as Audio Galaxy, Napster, Direct Connect,
Gnutella, Freenet, eDonkey2000, Kazaa, Morpheus, BitTorrent and Soulseek will
be discussed in the presentation. End user usage patterns based on net
cultural behavioral norms will be addressed as well as the development of
conflict as result of practicing such norms on a end user case-by-case basis.
Media attention and changes in policies of governance in relation to P2P
technology and usage are topics that will be touched on in the presentation.
New changes in P2P technology being made to maneuver difficulties that have
arisen from changes in governance policies are addressed later in the
presentation. The presentation's conclusion addresses technological
responsibility and safety practices the audience can use to prevent themselves
from becoming a marginalized end user as in the cases discussed earlier in the
presentation.</p>

<p>Many good, experienced high-level language programmers do not learn C or C++
well until they suddenly need to write an FFI extension, make an emergency
patch to an existing C or C++ codebase, re-implement the bottleneck component
in the application stack in a fast language, take an attractive job with a
low-level programming component, or otherwise move from their comfortable
language of choice and swallow the Red Pill of coding closer to the machine.
If you are already a programmer, you don't need to be taught how to program,
and your google-fu is strong for looking up detailed syntax.  Instead, this
will be a crash course in leveraging skills you learned in a high-level
environment and transferring them to these low-level tools, acquiring some new
skills you simply never needed before, and a building a mental picture of
where the road to expert, idiomatic mastery lies.  We will focus on plain C
because C++ is too complex to cover well in a single talk, but much of the
material will apply directly to C++.  Perhaps surprisingly, some of  it will
even make you a better programmer in your favorite comfortable,  higher-level
language.</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
<p>Some little-known facts about Dustin Laurence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>His first exposure to computers was playing Colossal Cave<br />
Adventure and the bootleg Fortran IV version of Zork on his cousin's work
mainframe using a glass teletype and a modem with a cradle for the handset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His first good programming language was C.  He lies and pretends that C is where he learned to program because 8-bit BASIC is embarrassing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He once gave up trying to learn the libc low-level I/O functions from the Ultrix man pages because he thought a buffer must be some kind of abstract data type provided by the C library and he couldn't find any documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He once confidently predicted that Linux was a temporary fad that would be replaced by BSD for serious work once the Berkeley codebase was completely free.  It's probably a good thing he doesn't gamble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He avoids social media for the same reason he doesn't do crack cocaine.</p>

<p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>In this talk, Zhangfan Xing will present webification (w10n), a data
virtualization technology that simplifies use of resources on the web
platform.</p>
<p>He will discuss science data challenges and share his experience on developing
open source solutions for NASA/JPL. In particular, he will use webification
for science (w10n-sci) as an example to demonstrate how one can bring together
a diverse set of data and visualize them, using modern web browser, in a rapid
and effective fashion.</p>
<p>He will also introduce the audience to the rich data collections available at
NASA data centers and elaborate on their potential values to web data
innovators.</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
<p>Zhangfan Xing is a technical lead at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  For over
a decade, he has been architecting and developing Information Technology
solutions for many NASA funded mission operations and research projects. He is
specialized in search technology, data analysis, web services and their
application to mission critical information and massive scientific datasets.
His recent work on webification has lead to novel web-based applications that
have had impact on NASA's mission operations and opened doors for the creation
of advanced data access and visualization technologies. He is among the first
in realizing the potential of the Web Platform as it applies to science data.</p>

<p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>OnSight is a tool that allows scientists to work on Mars through the power of
virtual reality. The Mars terrain displayed in OnSight is produced from real
images sent back by the Curiosity rover, and rendered at 1:1 scale, as if the
user were actually standing on Mars. Behind this exciting user experience is a
powerful backend infrastructure that continually produces 3D terrain
reconstructions as new images are sent back by the Curiosity rover.</p>
<p>The terrain build system automatically detects when new images are available,
dynamically starts and stops computing instances to handle the workload, and
presents dashboards to view the progress of terrain builds. The system runs on
Amazon's cloud services platform, using a mix of Linux and Windows virtual
computing instances. The system leverages a variety of open source projects
including NodeJS, LoopBack, Ansible, Jenkins, AngularJS, and BootStrap. In
this talk will focus on the cloud computing aspects of the terrain system,
rather than on image processing. I will present a detailed look at the parts
of this system, and discuss the team's experience adapting a desktop data
processing workflow to a cloud architecture. Please join me for an applied
look at how data processing challenges can be addressed in a cloud computing
environment.</p>

<p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>Liz Krane started the Learn to Code LA meetup group in 2015, and with
perseverance and some luck, the community grew to over 2200 members in less
than a year. In this talk, she will share what she learned by building a
community from scratch in a field she knew nothing about.</p>
<p>How do you build a community? From small open-source projects to international
movements, communities amplify our individual motivations and enable us to
create meaningful changes in the world. And on a personal level, communities
are essential for our well-being as social animals. What makes for a
successful community, and how do you persuade other people to get involved?</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
<p>Liz Krane is the founder of Learn to Code LA, a community that introduces new
people to computer science and programming with classes and fun events.Liz is
a professional dabbler who dreams of learning something about everything.
Previously a research assistant at USC Annenberg, she currently works as a
freelance web developer, writer, photographer and designer, exploring the
intersections between technology, education and journalism.</p>
<p><strong>Plan</strong></p>
<p>At about 7:30pm, we'll start the meeting with LUG business and Linux in the
News.  The talk will start shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>Since we didn't get to raffle off much stuff at our booth at SCALE, we'll be
doing some raffles during the next few meetings.  We will draw for the raffle
before and after the talk.  You will get a raffle ticket just for showing up.
You may earn extra raffle tickets for audience participation.</p>
