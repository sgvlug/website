                <div class="entry-content"> <p>A couple of "Core OS" developers from Linspire will be our guest speakers, and 
they'll talk about the interesting languages and technologies they use in    <br />
their distribution. When asked what they will present in detail, Clifford    <br />
responded, "The core OS group at Linspire recently announced that we are     <br />
standardizing on Haskell as our primary development language, whenever       <br />
appropriate. In reality, we have been using both O'Caml and Haskell for years. 
Projects include:                                                            <br />
<em> hardware detection and configuration,                                    <br />
</em> creation of installation CDs,                                            <br />
<em> package dependancy checker,                                              <br />
</em> translation utilities for IRMA, and                                      <br />
* many internal CGI/Web applications.                                        </p>
<p>"In the whirlwind of diversity that characterizes the Open Source development<br />
model, functional programming provides us an eye of tranquility. In          <br />
particular, static typing has proven invaluable. We will discuss the benefits<br />
of systems programming with functional languages using the management of a   <br />
Linux distribution as an example."                                             </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>The topic for the evening will be "Getting a job in 2006: Is it the dot-com  <br />
bubble all over again?" This event will include a presentation on the current<br />
state of the job market in Los Angeles, with special emphasis on tech roles  <br />
and open-source fields. There will also be a primer on how to prepare yourself 
to land the best job possible. Whether you are a linux guru or a newbie, this<br />
session will provide valuable information on how to land a great job. A major<br />
theme will be how to think like a corporate recruiter.                         </p>
<p>About the presenter:                                                         <br />
For over 5 years, Todd Cranston-Cuebas has led technology hiring at          <br />
Ticketmaster. He specializes in working with candidates who have backgrounds <br />
in open-source tools and technologies. He has spoken at BOF sessions at a    <br />
number of large technology conferences, including ApacheCon, OSCON, USENIX,  <br />
and, of course, at SGVLUG meetings. He also is the scheduler and host for this 
year's monthly perl-centric "Tech Talks" for the LA.pm.                        </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>PGP is an amazing tool for verification and encryption. However, many people <br />
don't fully understand it-even people who use it. This talk mostly will cover<br />
uses and effects of PGP. The discussion will focus on PGP and e-mail, and    <br />
other topics will be covered as well. How cryptography works and the math    <br />
behind it will not be covered.                                                 </p>

<p>One of the key features of PGP is the "web of trust" that grows out of       <br />
individuals signing each other's keys as a way of validating that the        <br />
keyholder is indeed the "owner" of the key. We encourge you to create a key  <br />
(if you don't already have one), post it to a public keyserver, and bring your 
"fingerprint" to the meeting for a keysigning party.                           </p>

<p>Due to a scheduling conflict, Chris was unable to present this last November,<br />
so we've asked him to return this month.                                       </p>
<p>Chris Smith of Yahoo! to present a slice of life-on-the-inside of the world's<br />

Research Labs, all of which is powered by UNIX and open source computing.      </p>
<p>A member of Yahoo!'s Research Technology team, Chris has more than 10 years of 
experience developing enterprise software solutions for both Internet        <br />

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Monthly meeting.                                                               </p>
<p>When you mention "running more than one operating system" on a computer, most<br />
people will think "dual boot", and for a wide variety of tasks that is quite <br />
appropriate. But how many of you have thought of running more than one system<br />
at the same time? Sure, you're only "one person," so why should the computer <br />
act like you were two people doing different things?                           </p>
<p>Well, you might not want to reboot your machine -- especially if you have a  <br />
long-running task going on such as "seti at home" (since rebooting will cause<br />
the "work unit" to be lost.) You might be a developer, and you're working on <br />
something intended to be "cross platform" -- if every "rebuild-and-test" cycle 
included "reboot the machine", you'd tire of it rather quickly. Or perhaps you 
have two programs, each of which runs under a different OS, but you need to  <br />
refer to the output of one program while working on the other.                 </p>
<p>If this describes you and you haven't heard of VMware, then you need to attend 
the February SGVLUG meeting. This month we'll have Phil Anthony, a Sr. Systems 
Engineer from VMware, here to talk about what VMware has to offer -- he plans<br />
to talk about the entier line -- from the ESX server to the workstation to   <br />
their newest offering, the "free" VMware player. (this is "free as in beer", <br />
folks...)                                                                      </p>

<p>Charles Finley of Transformix will be here to show off the Eclipse IDE by IBM. 
By popular vote, the presentation will be targeting the beginner, but there  <br />
will be plenty of opportunity to dig into deeper subjects.                     </p>
<p>Mr. Finley has extensive software development and consulting experience on the 
HP 3000, as well as on a variety of large-scale computers, minicomputers, and<br />
personal computers. He has over 30 years of combined experience in the data  <br />
processing industry and has held both technical and management positions. He <br />
has conducted over 70 computer-related seminars throughout the U.S. and Canada 
and is a former faculty member of the Industrial Relations Center at the     <br />
California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) in Pasadena. He studied        <br />
management at UCLA, received a Certificate in Data Processing (CDP) from the <br />
Data Processing Management Association, and holds a B.A. in business economics 
from the University of California, Santa Barbara.                              </p>
