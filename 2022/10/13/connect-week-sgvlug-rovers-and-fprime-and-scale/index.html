Stick around to talk one-on-one with the guest speakers. Agenda: 6:45pm Announcements 7:00pm Southern California Linux Expo Call for Papers and call for volunteers 7:15pm Michael Starch will give a tour of the newly released F&#39; system reference. The F´framework was developed at NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to make spacecraft control and embedded software simpler to design, develop, and test. F´ was released as Open Source in 2017 and has continued to grow as a project and community. 7:30pm Lini Mestar and interns Victor Jimenez and Jack Cheng will talk about the current work they&#39;re doing with the JPL Open Source Rover at JPL. The OSR was developed by JPL summer interns as an inexpensive project for high school and college classes to exercise mechanical and electronics and software engineering. It is currently being developed by the https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover, but the OSR has proved to be a useful robotics platform at universities and at JPL. 7:45pm Achille Verheye will talk about the Open Source Rover community and the work they&#39;ve been doing on a complete redesign of the OSR. 8:00pm Lan Dang will be soliciting advice and interest in restarting work on the SGVHAK Rover, which was part of the pilot for the Open Source Rover, but has evolved to its own design. 8:05pm Break up into individual discussions 8:45pm Wrap up -- About the speakers Michael Starch has worked at NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory for over 10 years. His latest job is designing and building the software used to control JPL&#39;s spacecraft. He is also the community manager overseeing the development of the F´ software framework. Lini Mestar is a Senior Research Engineer for the Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Innovation Development Organization in the Information Technology and Solutions Directorate (ITSD) at NASA JPL. (See his official bio for more details. Victor Jimenez is a second-generation Latino at East Los Angeles Community College passionate in research and design of mechanical vehicles. He is looking to transfer and obtain a Bachelor&#39;s of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Cal Poly Pomona. Jack Cheng is a student at Pasadena City College and obsessed with robotics and technology. He spends all his free time designing and making things. Achille Verheye is a Sr. robotics engineer at Freedom Robotics where he builds management and control software for fleets of rovers. He has designed and built several robots from scratch and maintains the NASA-JPL Open Source Rover in his spare time. Lan Dang is a leader of the SGVLUG and its sister group, the SGVHAK hardware hacking group, mentors new hires at work as well as local high school and college students, and volunteers with various STEAM groups and events. She has a lot of experience herding cats. -- About Connect Week Innovate Pasadena launched Connect Week as a festival of independently organized talks, workshops, and social events produced by independent organizers and hosted in venues all across Pasadena. During Connect Week we invite entrepreneurs, engineers, investors, scientists, educators, businesspeople, designers, and students to unite and celebrate the creativity and ingenuity that’s right here in our own backyard. -- NOTE: The SGVLUG meetings are primarily organized on Meetup. We have had regularly monthly meetings from July 2020 to current day, but we had not been doing a good job of keeping the website up-to-date."/>
