    <p>Monthly meeting.                                                               </p>
<p>When you mention "running more than one operating system" on a computer, most<br />
people will think "dual boot", and for a wide variety of tasks that is quite <br />
appropriate. But how many of you have thought of running more than one system<br />
at the same time? Sure, you're only "one person," so why should the computer <br />
act like you were two people doing different things?                           </p>
<p>Well, you might not want to reboot your machine -- especially if you have a  <br />
long-running task going on such as "seti at home" (since rebooting will cause<br />
the "work unit" to be lost.) You might be a developer, and you're working on <br />
something intended to be "cross platform" -- if every "rebuild-and-test" cycle 
included "reboot the machine", you'd tire of it rather quickly. Or perhaps you 
have two programs, each of which runs under a different OS, but you need to  <br />
refer to the output of one program while working on the other.                 </p>
<p>If this describes you and you haven't heard of VMware, then you need to attend 
the February SGVLUG meeting. This month we'll have Phil Anthony, a Sr. Systems 
Engineer from VMware, here to talk about what VMware has to offer -- he plans<br />
to talk about the entier line -- from the ESX server to the workstation to   <br />
their newest offering, the "free" VMware player. (this is "free as in beer", <br />
folks...)                                                                      </p>
<p>Date: Thursday February 9, 2006 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM                              <br />
Location: Downs 107                                         </p>
