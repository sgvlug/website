    <p>Monitoring the Local Weather with Linux                                        </p>
<p>There are plenty of websites that will give you a weather report for your    <br />
city, but what about your neighborhood? Ever wonder how hot your attic got   <br />
during the summer or how well your air conditioner is working? Claude        <br />
Felizardo will describe his 1-wire weather station and how it has grown from a 
simple kit with a single temperature sensor, wind speed, and direction to    <br />
multiple sensors located throughout his house and publishes the measurements <br />
to the Internet.                                                               </p>
<p>About the Presenter:                                                           </p>
<p>Claude has over 15 years experience developing software on Unix platforms and<br />
has been playing with Linux since the late 90's. His friends and family think<br />
he has too many gadgets, but he's always looking for something new to play   <br />
with, especially if it works with Linux.                                       </p>
<p>Date: Thursday November 9, 2006 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM                              <br />
