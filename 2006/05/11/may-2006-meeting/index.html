    <p>The topic for the evening will be "Getting a job in 2006: Is it the dot-com  <br />
bubble all over again?" This event will include a presentation on the current<br />
state of the job market in Los Angeles, with special emphasis on tech roles  <br />
and open-source fields. There will also be a primer on how to prepare yourself 
to land the best job possible. Whether you are a linux guru or a newbie, this<br />
session will provide valuable information on how to land a great job. A major<br />
theme will be how to think like a corporate recruiter.                         </p>
