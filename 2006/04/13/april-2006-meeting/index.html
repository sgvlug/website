    <p>PGP is an amazing tool for verification and encryption. However, many people <br />
don't fully understand it-even people who use it. This talk mostly will cover<br />
uses and effects of PGP. The discussion will focus on PGP and e-mail, and    <br />
other topics will be covered as well. How cryptography works and the math    <br />
behind it will not be covered.                                                 </p>
<p>Keysigning party                                                               </p>
<p>One of the key features of PGP is the "web of trust" that grows out of       <br />
individuals signing each other's keys as a way of validating that the        <br />
keyholder is indeed the "owner" of the key. We encourge you to create a key  <br />
(if you don't already have one), post it to a public keyserver, and bring your 
"fingerprint" to the meeting for a keysigning party.                           </p>
