  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>MySQL replication. MySQL Replication is the means by which one or more MySQL <br />
databases can keep data synchronized with a master server. The scope of      <br />
replicated data can cover any range, whether a single table, or              <br />
indiscriminately all the databases on the master server. MySQL Replication is<br />
beginning to find progressively more exposure in corporate production        <br />
environments, where it sees use from providing hot backups, to distributing  <br />
access load amongst large numbers of users. Solomon Chang will cover four main 
topics:                                                                      <br />
<em> Requirements of MySQL Replication                                        <br />
</em> Concepts of MySQL Replication                                            <br />
<em> Configuring MySQL Replication                                            <br />
</em> Troubleshooting MySQL Replication                                          </p>
<p>Soloman will provide a master to replicate from, so attendees are encouraged <br />
to bring their own computers running MySQL (4.1 or later, please) to configure 
as a hands-on slave. Attendees will also have full access to Solomon's master. 
If there is time, more advanced topics will be discussed:                    <br />
<em> Pyramid Architectures                                                    <br />
</em> Dual Masters                                                             <br />
<em> Circular Replication                                                     <br />
</em> Circular Replication of Masters                                            </p>
