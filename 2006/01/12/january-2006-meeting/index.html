HP 3000, as well as on a variety of large-scale computers, minicomputers, and<br />
personal computers. He has over 30 years of combined experience in the data  <br />
processing industry and has held both technical and management positions. He <br />
has conducted over 70 computer-related seminars throughout the U.S. and Canada 
and is a former faculty member of the Industrial Relations Center at the     <br />
California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) in Pasadena. He studied        <br />
management at UCLA, received a Certificate in Data Processing (CDP) from the <br />
Data Processing Management Association, and holds a B.A. in business economics 
from the University of California, Santa Barbara.                              </p>
