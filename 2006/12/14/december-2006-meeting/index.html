    <p>Why Linux needs to be more like Windows -or- Impediments to enterprise Linux <br />
adoption                                                                       </p>
<p>Our speaker is Steve Friedl, a software consultant in Orange County who's been 
using UNIX since the early '80s, using Windows since the late '80s, and has  <br />
more than 20 years of cross-platform consulting and commercial software      <br />
development experience. He has taught advanced C/UNIX at Bell Labs, and is the 
only Microsoft MVP with "unix" in his domain name (unixwiz.net).               </p>
<p>He'll be making the case that Linux has some stumbling blocks that make      <br />
enterprise management and deployment much more difficult than they need to be, 
and what road there might be to make some progress on these fronts.            </p>
<p>Date: Thursday December 14, 2006 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM                             <br />
