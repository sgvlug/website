    <p>A couple of "Core OS" developers from Linspire will be our guest speakers, and 
they'll talk about the interesting languages and technologies they use in    <br />
their distribution. When asked what they will present in detail, Clifford    <br />
responded, "The core OS group at Linspire recently announced that we are     <br />
standardizing on Haskell as our primary development language, whenever       <br />
appropriate. In reality, we have been using both O'Caml and Haskell for years. 
Projects include:                                                            <br />
<em> hardware detection and configuration,                                    <br />
</em> creation of installation CDs,                                            <br />
<em> package dependancy checker,                                              <br />
</em> translation utilities for IRMA, and                                      <br />
* many internal CGI/Web applications.                                        </p>
<p>"In the whirlwind of diversity that characterizes the Open Source development<br />
model, functional programming provides us an eye of tranquility. In          <br />
particular, static typing has proven invaluable. We will discuss the benefits<br />
of systems programming with functional languages using the management of a   <br />
Linux distribution as an example."                                             </p>
