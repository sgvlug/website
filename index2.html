<p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>Protecting your digital identity, passwords, and browsing activity is
difficult in the world of open Wifi networks, freeware, and advanced
advertising techniques based on tracking users across the web. While complete
privacy is not possible while connected to the internet, there are many things
you can do to make access to your personal data more difficult. This
presentation will focus on the basics of internet security, how to begin
protecting your network and your data, and why it's so important. We will
focus on the two most prominent (and easiest to fix) security vulnerabilities:
encrypting your browsing on external networks using OpenVPN, and blocking
advertising and tracking as early as possible using Pi-Hole.  </p>

<p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>The open science movement calls for open sharing of research findings and
greater trust, transparency, and reuseability in making claims and reporting
results. A researcher-to-researcher training community known as Carpentry
(Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and others) has emerged to prepare
researchers to practice open science using more open and collaborative
practices; open source tools; and openly licensed and distributed methods,
data, code.</p>
<p>In this program, the Head of Research Services at the Caltech Library will
describe the Carpentry movement; illustrate how lesson development and
delivery takes place; and lead participants through a sample interactive
lesson from Data Carpentry.</p>
<p>There will be an interactive lesson.  Please bring a fully charged laptop.<br />
Installation instructions and lesson outline will be posted ahead of time. 
OpenX has guest wifi.
<strong>We will comment in the Meetup, if there are any updates.</strong></p>
