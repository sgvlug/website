<p>Dinner begins around 7pm and the presentation will start after most people

<p><strong>The Trouble with Rovers</strong></p>
<p>The JPL Open Source Rover is a relatively inexpensive and accessible project
for high school and college classes to exercise mechanical and electronics and
software engineering using parts that could be easily sourced from hobbyist
stores.</p>
<p>JPL beta-tested their build instructions at a few schools and with the SGVHAK
maker group. The ultimate goal was to refine the build instructions and grow a
community of experienced builders to help provide support once the rover
documentation and code were open sourced.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover">https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover</a></p>
<p>We will go over the experience of the SGVHAK maker group in building the
SGVHAK rover and being inspired to build rovers of our own design. The SGVHAK
maker group built the rover over the period of 3 months while giving JPL
significant feedback and build photos. We diverged from the original design
most significantly in the wheel design, motor selection, and software.</p>
<p>We were able to exhibit the SGVHAK rover at SCALE, the Caltech Science for
March, and the DTLA Mini Maker Faire. We were recently interviewed for the
Command_Line Heroes podcast. Building rovers is a never-ending process. The
SGVHAK rover itself is always under construction. We have plans to add a robot
arm, pan-tilt webcam, and maybe even lidar. Our members have already started
coming up with their own rover designs and builds. All the code and 3D printer
files are on GitHub. Come join us in our rover-building adventures.</p>
<p><strong>About Lan</strong></p>
<p>Lan Dang is an Operations Engineer with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
specializing in science data systems operations and large scale data
processing. Her contributions to open source focus on community-building and
evangelism. In her spare time, she is active in the San Gabriel Valley tech
community as a leader of the SGVLUG and its sister group, the SGVHAK hardware
hacking group, mentors new hires at work as well as local high school and
college students, and volunteers with various STEAM groups and events. She is

<p><strong>How (and Why) to Choose an Open Source License</strong></p>
<p>There is a common misconception that just because your code is public on GitHub
that it is open source, but unless there is a license in your codebase, then it
is by default copyrighted. This talk will cover an introduction to copyright,
open source, the types of open source licenses, how to go about choosing an
open source license for your project, and why should you choose to open
source your project.</p>
<p><strong>The Hitchhiker's Guide to Markdown</strong></p>
<p>Markdown is the most commonly used lightweight markup language on the internet.
However, lately it has been adopted by the technical writing community as a
solution for writing documentation. This has made a lot of people very angry and
been widely regarded as a bad move.</p>
<p><strong>BIO</strong></p>
<p>Sean Marquez graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in
design of dynamic systems, from UC Irvine. During his undergrad, he project
managed a CubeSat program where he developed a passion for space exploration. He
worked for an OEM aerospace consulting firm for over a year as an associate
mechanical design engineer. In 2015, he joined and collaborated with an online
team, performing numerical simulations &amp; control systems design, for rLoop – a
non-profit global think tank that won the innovation award for the first SpaceX
hyperloop pod competition. Sean is currently a worker-owner at Space Cooperative
Inc., involved with development and testing of smart contracts to be utilized by
the Space Decentral network, collaborating on Coral - an open source robotic

<p>"I was monitoring a server room's temperature, but getting tired of going to
the room every, single, time. I used Arduino to create a device that would do
the job for me. However, it involved messy wiring, dangerous soldering, and
complicated coding. And so an idea was born. I wanted to create something that
anyone could use to imagine a product and immediately just build it. The very
first set of Microduino modules was designed to lower the barriers to
creativity for everyone. We're giving people the freedom to give shape to
their ideas."</p>
<p>The company creates the world's smallest Arduino-compatible smart modules.
These modules are flexible, stackable and powerful, and can be used to create
a limitless amount of DIY projects for all ages.</p>

better code. If you enjoy these types of talks, please see Michael and Carlos
afterwards about more meetups on good software design.</p>
<p><strong>TOPIC</strong></p>
<p>JavaScript, like all computer languages, has its flaws. It at times subtly
encourages programmers to commit unabsolvable crimes against the computing
world. It drags new programmers into the abyss of bad practice with the
madness of Lisp and the folly of QuickBasic. Together we shall journey into
the darkness surrounding JavaScript and shine our light into it.</p>
<p>Attendees should expect to learn a bit about the downside to JavaScript and
some of the bad practices that arise. We will then improve our JavaScript code
by establishing good patterns using modern JavaScript and an understanding of
software design principles. If nothing else attendees shall be thoroughly
entertained, and all will rag on JavaScript just a wee bit.</p>
<p><strong>BIO</strong></p>
<p>Michael Starch in an Engineer. He has used JavaScript professionally for many
years, and has committed every sin in JavaScript's tomb of Evil. He has often
searched for order amongst the chaotic statements of JavaScript, and brings
his methods for your consideration. He is by no means an authority on
JavaScript, but he will step up and speak with authority anyway. You shall be
entertained.</p>
