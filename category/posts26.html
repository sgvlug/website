Simulation, and Really Remote Scheduling," Scott Maxwell and Frank Hartman,  <br />
NASA JPL.                                                                      </p>
<p>NASA/JPL's Mars Exploration Rover project is the first time a JPL flight     <br />
project has used Linux systems for critical mission operations. Scott Maxwell<br />
and Frank Hartman, two of MER's rover drivers, also wrote the Rover Sequencing 
and Visualization Program (RSVP), the Linux-based software used on Earth to  <br />
drive Spirit and Opportunity. Scott and Frank will discuss the software they <br />
developed, as well as their experiences using Linux to drive two vehicles    <br />
across the Martian terrain, a hundred million miles from Earth.                </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Mark Echeverri, who has years of experience in traditional software and      <br />
systems engineering, says: "For the past couple of months, I've been working <br />
with Plone. It's an impressive system, and not exactly something you pick up <br />
in a Saturday. Previously, I had never done any Web-related development; Plone 
is a Zope tool that allows you to juggle Web portals like bowling            <br />
pins...provided you know how to take advantage of it. Quite powerful."         </p>
<p>About Zope and Plone:                                                          </p>
<p>"Zope is an open source application server for building content management   <br />
systems, intranets, portals, and custom applications....Zope is written in   <br />
Python, a highly-productive, object-oriented scripting language."              </p>
<p>For more information, see http://www.zope.org/                                 </p>
<p>"Plone is an out-of-the-box ready content management system that is built on <br />
the powerful and free Zope Application server. It requires minimal effort to <br />
set up, is deeply flexible, and provides you with a system for managing web  <br />
content that is ideal for project groups, communities and intranets."          </p>
