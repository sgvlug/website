<p>In this talk, Zhangfan Xing will present webification (w10n), a data
virtualization technology that simplifies use of resources on the web
platform.</p>
<p>He will discuss science data challenges and share his experience on developing
open source solutions for NASA/JPL. In particular, he will use webification
for science (w10n-sci) as an example to demonstrate how one can bring together
a diverse set of data and visualize them, using modern web browser, in a rapid
and effective fashion.</p>
<p>He will also introduce the audience to the rich data collections available at
NASA data centers and elaborate on their potential values to web data
innovators.</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
<p>Zhangfan Xing is a technical lead at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  For over
a decade, he has been architecting and developing Information Technology
solutions for many NASA funded mission operations and research projects. He is
specialized in search technology, data analysis, web services and their
application to mission critical information and massive scientific datasets.
His recent work on webification has lead to novel web-based applications that
have had impact on NASA's mission operations and opened doors for the creation
of advanced data access and visualization technologies. He is among the first
in realizing the potential of the Web Platform as it applies to science data.</p>

<p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>OnSight is a tool that allows scientists to work on Mars through the power of
virtual reality. The Mars terrain displayed in OnSight is produced from real
images sent back by the Curiosity rover, and rendered at 1:1 scale, as if the
user were actually standing on Mars. Behind this exciting user experience is a
powerful backend infrastructure that continually produces 3D terrain
reconstructions as new images are sent back by the Curiosity rover.</p>
<p>The terrain build system automatically detects when new images are available,
dynamically starts and stops computing instances to handle the workload, and
presents dashboards to view the progress of terrain builds. The system runs on
Amazon's cloud services platform, using a mix of Linux and Windows virtual
computing instances. The system leverages a variety of open source projects
including NodeJS, LoopBack, Ansible, Jenkins, AngularJS, and BootStrap. In
this talk will focus on the cloud computing aspects of the terrain system,
rather than on image processing. I will present a detailed look at the parts
of this system, and discuss the team's experience adapting a desktop data
processing workflow to a cloud architecture. Please join me for an applied
look at how data processing challenges can be addressed in a cloud computing
environment.</p>

<p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>Liz Krane started the Learn to Code LA meetup group in 2015, and with
perseverance and some luck, the community grew to over 2200 members in less
than a year. In this talk, she will share what she learned by building a
community from scratch in a field she knew nothing about.</p>
<p>How do you build a community? From small open-source projects to international
movements, communities amplify our individual motivations and enable us to
create meaningful changes in the world. And on a personal level, communities
are essential for our well-being as social animals. What makes for a
successful community, and how do you persuade other people to get involved?</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
<p>Liz Krane is the founder of Learn to Code LA, a community that introduces new
people to computer science and programming with classes and fun events.Liz is
a professional dabbler who dreams of learning something about everything.
Previously a research assistant at USC Annenberg, she currently works as a
freelance web developer, writer, photographer and designer, exploring the
intersections between technology, education and journalism.</p>
<p><strong>Plan</strong></p>
<p>At about 7:30pm, we'll start the meeting with LUG business and Linux in the
News.  The talk will start shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>Since we didn't get to raffle off much stuff at our booth at SCALE, we'll be
doing some raffles during the next few meetings.  We will draw for the raffle
before and after the talk.  You will get a raffle ticket just for showing up.
You may earn extra raffle tickets for audience participation.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<p>OpenX is located in the One West Bank building @ 888 E Walnut St.  Pasadena CA, 91101. Entrances to the building are eastbound on Walnut, right hand side before the Lake St. intersection or southbound on Lake St. right hand side after the Walnut St. intersection. Once through the driveway, please park in the 888 Lot that has the OpenX logo displayed out front. Pull a ticket and bring it with you to the Meet-Up, we will validate your parking.</p>

talk</a> on DNSSEC.
Why should you care?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"DNSSec is an absolute requirement if we want to ... use the Internet for anything non-trivial." - Cricket Liu, Leading expert on the Domain Name System (DNS)</p>
<p>"The Internet needs this technology and it needs it now" - Vint Cerf, Father of the Internet</p>
<p>"It is arguably one of the most important security improvements to the Internet ever." -Steve Crocker, Internet Pioneer and Chair of the Board of ICANN</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>DNS (Domain Name System) is used by everyone who is a consumer of the Internet. It is a core component of the Internet, yet it is completely insecure. This puts us all at risk. DNSSEC offers a solution to address the vulnerabilities of DNS . For this reason I hope stir up demand and motivation to deploy DNSSEC.</p>
<p>We will go over the basic of DNS and its vulnerabilities. Then we will go over how DNSSEC works and the solution it provides. As users, we will look at why it is important for our safety to require that our service providers (ISPs, Registrars, Hosted Services (banking, commerce, etc)) provide DNSSEC. And we will also look at some user-end tools available to advantage of DNSSEC today.  We will go over reasons why companies would want to make the effort and investment. For sysadmins, we will go over tools to aid with deployment and some considerations  to be aware of.</p>
<p>At its essence, DNS translates names, that humans understand, to IP addresses, that computers understand. This is how we are able to find other computers on the Internet (webpages, email servers, etc). But DNS does not provide a way to validate the answer we receive. This exposes all of us to a large vulnerability. Exploits such as DNS hijacking and DNS cache poisoning miss direct us and can lead us to potentially malicious computers. DNSSEC provides a solution to this by allowing authentication of DNS data through a chain-of- trust. Being able to trust DNS goes a long way to creating a safer Internet.</p>
<p>When we can trust DNS other things become possible. We can now leverage DNS to store other information such as cryptographic keys. This means we can store and trust self signed SSL certificates in DNS because it is now a trusted source. This eliminates the need for certificate authorities and the issues with them.</p>
<p>DNSSEC is a great improvement on a fundamental component of the Internet we
all us.</p>
<p><strong>Biography:</strong></p>
<p>Carlos has worked many years as a system administrator. His interest include InfoSec, site reliability and automation, and open source development.  While volunteering as an Interop Team Member, he was introduced to the significance of DNSSEC.</p>

<!--    <strong>About SGVLUG</strong><br/> -->
    The SGVLUG meetings are primarily organized on the SGVTech Meetup.  Look for a meeting on the 2nd Thursday of the month, usually in Pasadena.  During the quarantine period, our meetings are virtual.  You can also find us on Slack.  This website is not updated often.
