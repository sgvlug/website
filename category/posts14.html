<h2>Topic: Virtualmin / Webmin + Brief review Defcon/Blackhat:</h2>
<p>Take your Drupal sites to the next level with the free, open-source Webmin   <br />
control panel and its powerful Virtualmin plug-in. Add as many features as you 
want, including unlimited domains, mail accounts, Subversion repositories,   <br />
mailing lists, and more with a point-and-click web interface.                  </p>
<p>Webmin and Virtualmin are similar to cPanel and WHM, respectively, and can   <br />
manage dozens or even hundreds of domains. They are the perfect tools for    <br />
creating test and development sites, hosting client websites or even managing<br />
a full-blown online infrastructure for running a business.                     </p>
<p>Did we forget to mention, Webmin and Virtualmin are free* and open-source?   <br />
Compared to site licensing costs of cPanel, WHM, Plesk and other proprietary <br />
control panels, Webmin and Virtualmin cost only as much as a basic           <br />
$10-20/month VPS account.                                                      </p>
<p>Bio: ----- Christefano is CEO and Co-founder of Exaltation of Larks, where   <br />
Virtualmin has been a key ingredient for rapid website deployment. He is a   <br />
sysadmin for LA Drupal and the DrupalCamp LA website (which uses Virtualmin) <br />
and has been on the Drupal.org and groups.drupal.org webmaster teams since   <br />

<p>APRS is a amateur radio network where small packets of data such as position <br />
reports, messages or telemetry are transmitted to other radio operators and  <br />
eventually propagated to the Internet.                                       <br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System                 </p>
<p>The proliferation of small, low power and easily hackable ARM devices opens up 
many possibilities for setting up unobtrusive computing solutions. Amateur   <br />
radio operator and long time Linux user James McDuffie (K6JLM) explores using<br />
the Seagate GoFlex Net along with surplus amateur radio equipment to build a <br />
APRS digipeater for helping to relay packets both over RF and to the Internet. </p>

Decathlon will present their project, for which they are using various       <br />
open-source technology.                                                        </p>
<p>"The Solar Decathlon is a U.S. Department of Energy Sponsored competition    <br />
which challenges teams of college and graduate students from around the world<br />
to design and build solar-powered, net-zero houses. Inside the SCI-Arc/Caltech 
entry, code named CHIP, a sophisticated home automation system monitors every<br />
watt of electricity consumed and visually communicates the information to    <br />
homeowners. It also plays a central role in optimizing the behavior of the   <br />
house at all times, such as by controlling operation of the active thermal   <br />
mass, shutting down appliances or lights that are no longer used, and of     <br />
course giving the homeowners an instant understanding into how their own     <br />
behaviors affects their energy use and in turn their energy bill."             </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Topic: Todd CC will discuss the impact of a world with rapidly changing      <br />
technologies, radical fluctuations in staffing needs, and changes in the     <br />
employer/employee dynamic and how you can be best prepared for your next job <br />
