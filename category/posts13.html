grab-bag of interesting topics:                                              <br />
<em> Quick Picasa 2.7 for Linux demo. (Picasa is Google's photo management    <br />
  software for Windows and Linux, but many people don't know about the Linux 
  version)                                                                 <br />
</em> Quick Wine status report. (Wine is Linux's implementation of Win32; it   <br />
  lets you run many Windows applications.)                                 <br />
* Introduction to Zumastor. (Zumastor is Linux's answer to ZFS, kind of; it<br />
  lets you take atomic snapshots of any filesystem, and easily replicate   <br />
  those snapshots to remote systems.)                                        </p>
<p>Dan is a developer for all three projects and was elected the release manager<br />
for the upcoming 1.0 release of Wine, so feel free to ask all the technical  <br />
questions you like.                                                            </p>

distribution, voice mail and interactive voice response menus. X10 is a      <br />
power-line carrier protocol for controlling lights and appliances. What can  <br />
you do when you combine them? Claude Felizardo will give us an update on his <br />
home-automation system and how integrating Asterisk has moved his home closer<br />
to what is depicted in popular science fiction.                                </p>
<p>With over 15 years as a Unix developer, Claude got his start with Linux in the 
late 90s when he built his own firewall. Most of his friends and family think<br />
he has too many gadgets, but he's always looking for something new to play   <br />
with, especially if it can be integrated into his system at home. His previous 
presentations include an Intro to Home Automation, Hacking TiVo and Monitoring 
the Weather with Linux.                                                        </p>

typesetting system and its application to real-world document production. He <br />
will explain how he uses it in the creation of essays, books, and letters    <br />
incorporating graphics. He will also demonstrate the use of LaTeX in his     <br />
band's annual fund drive which requires the creation of personalized letters <br />
(mail merge) and envelopes.                                                    </p>
<p>Initially designed to typeset mathematical formulae, the LaTeX system        <br />
incorporates world-class fonts with international symbols. The system        <br />
successfully handles the automatic typesetting of complicated textbooks with <br />
thousands of images and internal page, chapter, and figure references. The   <br />
line-breaking algorithm used by LaTeX (or more accurately, by the more basic <br />
TeX engine) is the industry leader (eventually adopted by Adobe for its      <br />
commercial program, InDesign).                                                 </p>
<p>About the presenter:                                                         <br />
Kris Bergstrom was first exposed to GNU/Linux in electronic music courses at <br />
Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. In 2000,     <br />
excited by the ideals of Free Software, he tried to switch his desktop from  <br />
Windows to Debian but with limited knowledge of networking and basic admin   <br />
tasks, was unable to get a basic system up and running. Soon after moving to <br />
Los Angeles in 2002, he joined a Linux Users Group and found the support he  <br />
needed to do all his personal and business computer tasks with free software.  </p>

latest incarnation uses the hybrid-hosted model developed by Fonality for    <br />
PBXtra, but gives installers the control over the hardware and phone         <br />

ranging from IT Director of a large multi-site distribution company to       <br />
developing a large hosted web server platform for a major ISP, to running his<br />
own IT consulting business in Southern California. Kerry was introduced to the 
world of Asterisk by a friend and began installing Asterisk-based phone      <br />
systems for his small business clients. He wrote articles about Asterisk and <br />
trixbox that became extremely popular on the net, and eventually published the 
definitive book on trixbox, "trixbox Made Easy." Today, Kerry is the senior  <br />
product development manager for trixbox at Fonality. Kerry regularly speaks at 
trade shows, user groups, and radio programs. He is also the publisher of both

infrastructure that PGP and others do, X509 (and SSL by extension) are more  <br />
complicated. Extending beyond the basic encryption, signing, decryption, and <br />
verification of basic PKI, X509 includes a variety of extra pieces and       <br />
information enabling more features. This talk will cover what X509 and SSL   <br />
are, how they relate, how to use them, and how to learn more. It will discuss<br />
PKI from both an certificate end-user perspective as well as from a          <br />
Certificate Authority perspective. If time permits, a small comparison to PGP<br />
will also be included akin to the one at the end of my PGP talk.               </p>
