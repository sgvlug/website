                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Unity is the new desktop environment for Ubuntu, having first premiered in   <br />
version 11.04, significantly enhanced with version 11.10, and very much the  <br />
cornerstone of the upcoming 12.04 release.                                     </p>
<p>A striking departure from Gnome 2, Unity has been seen as a source of        <br />
controversy in the Linux world.                                                </p>
<p>This talk will outline some of the design goals that Unity addresses, noting <br />
strengths, weaknesses, and improvements across the three versions of Ubuntu in 
which it's been included.                                                      </p>
<p>While Unity offers many usability affordances, some Ubuntu users prefer to   <br />
customize it for their specific workflows. Linux is famous for its           <br />
customizability, and Unity is no exception if you know which tools to look   <br />
for.                                                                           </p>
<p>This presentation will outline some of the tools available through the Ubuntu<br />
Software Center to show you how to customize the Unity interface.              </p>
<p>Speaker Bio: Richard Gaskin is President of Fourth World, a software design  <br />

Congress, and hundreds of universities around the world.                       </p>
<p>Although he started his career with Mac OS, Richard has since delivered      <br />
applications for Irix, every version of Windows, and has been developing for <br />
Linux for the last two years.                                                  </p>

<p>The idea is to have a fun meeting with some scary stories and trouble shooting 
lessons to be learned. Depending on how quickly the presentation goes we may <br />
have time to share more, so please feel free to bring your horror story and  <br />
what you did to resolve it.                                                    </p>

reschedule.                                                                    </p>
<p>Virtual Private Servers: On a Budget - We will discuss a class of virtual    <br />
private servers available at a low price point allowing individuals to get   <br />
many of the benefits of dedicated hardware without the cost thanks to        <br />
virtualization technologies and a competitive marketplace.                     </p>

<p>Lan Dang spends the majority of her working hours monitoring and             <br />
troubleshooting data processing systems on Linux-based computer clusters. She<br />
has accumulated a number of tips and tricks to deal with the command line. Her 
arsenal includes: GNU screen, awk, sed, shell scripting, remote ssh command  <br />
execution, bash command history, and a variety of system utilities. This talk<br />
will cover useful one-liners and the small set of useful commands that will  <br />
get you started using these tools or using them in new ways. Whether you're a<br />
newbie or a command line guru, you'll probably pick up something useful for  <br />
the next time you're at the command line.                                      </p>
