                <div class="entry-content"> <p>After over 12 years trying to get the video games studio industry to both
create and use more open source software and unrestricted hardware, Jared
Hardy finally gave up on those proprietary-minded fools, and started building
NELA-ISC.Net instead. In the process of bootstrapping this Northeast LA
community utility cooperative (still in progress), he discovered the catch-22
of funding nonprofit community projects that can never take any tax deductible
donations or returns-based investments. He then started the deductible-
donation accepting Data Roads Foundation to help solve that catch-22
investment problem -- among other issues inherent to all cooperatively owned
networks. More about that and his other yak shaving projects are available in
the links below:</p>

provide good conversation fodder for Thursday night 6/12!</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

talk about the evolution of the One Laptop per Child Project into Unleash
Kids, their successes and failures working with schools, establishing a
lasting infrastructure, and the technology behind it all.</p>
<p>Some of the projects they will talk about are a mission school using OLPC
laptops and a school server providing internet caching/filtering servers, a
remote off-the-grid school using only solar power to charge ten laptops, an
orphanage with twenty computers and miniature solar panels, and several
schools using Internet-in-a-Box, an offline source of Wikipedia, Khan Academy,
and Open Street Map.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
