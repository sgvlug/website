                <div class="entry-content"> <p>In a presentation called "Geotagging with Linux and Free Software," Tom      <br />
Emerson will describe geotagging, the process of adding geographical         <br />
information to images, which can later be searched. Emerson will show how he <br />
has geotagged photos from his recent vacation and can search for them using  <br />
various search engines, including Google Earth.                                </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Wilfred Nilsen will present the BarracudaDrive, a secure Web application server 
for the Linksys NSLU2 (Network Storage Link for USB 2.0 Disk Drives) using the<br />
Unslung Linux firmware replacement. Using an external USB Flash memory for    <br />
storing the database files, it should be possible to create an application    <br />
server that is virtually maintenance free.                                      </p>
<p>Wilfred will be here to give a demo of the NSLU2 running BarracudaDrive,      <br />
including the many practical features of BarracudaDrive and how some users use<br />
BarracudaDrive for many non traditional Web server tasks.                       </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Ronald Stewart, creative director of the Trinity Audio Group will speak at the 
next San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group. He will present the                <br />
yet-to-be-released InDaMixx appliance, a full-featured, hand-held recording  <br />
studio built on Linux (a customized version of 64Studio, to be more specific). 
He will go over topics such as why Linux was chosen, the future of music in  <br />
the open-source community and will demo some of the great features of        <br />
InDaMixx.                                                                      </p>
<p>Ronald's background in the music industry goes back to the late 80's as a DJ &amp; 
Remixer for Factor 3 Records, Tommy Boy Records, Bullet Proof Records &amp; one of 
the first beta testers for Digidesign's Pro Tools. Ronald decided that he    <br />
needed a full-featured device that he could take with him, along with all his<br />
music only to find out nothing like this existed. Ever the frontiersman,     <br />
Ronald decided to blaze the trail, chose all open-source applications and    <br />
hasn't looked back ever since.                                                 </p>
