                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Why Linux needs to be more like Windows -or- Impediments to enterprise Linux <br />
adoption                                                                       </p>
<p>Our speaker is Steve Friedl, a software consultant in Orange County who's been 
using UNIX since the early '80s, using Windows since the late '80s, and has  <br />
more than 20 years of cross-platform consulting and commercial software      <br />
development experience. He has taught advanced C/UNIX at Bell Labs, and is the 
only Microsoft MVP with "unix" in his domain name (unixwiz.net).               </p>
<p>He'll be making the case that Linux has some stumbling blocks that make      <br />
enterprise management and deployment much more difficult than they need to be, 
and what road there might be to make some progress on these fronts.            </p>

<p>There are plenty of websites that will give you a weather report for your    <br />
city, but what about your neighborhood? Ever wonder how hot your attic got   <br />
during the summer or how well your air conditioner is working? Claude        <br />
Felizardo will describe his 1-wire weather station and how it has grown from a 
simple kit with a single temperature sensor, wind speed, and direction to    <br />
multiple sensors located throughout his house and publishes the measurements <br />
to the Internet.                                                               </p>
<p>About the Presenter:                                                           </p>
<p>Claude has over 15 years experience developing software on Unix platforms and<br />
has been playing with Linux since the late 90's. His friends and family think<br />
he has too many gadgets, but he's always looking for something new to play   <br />
with, especially if it works with Linux.                                       </p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>MySQL replication. MySQL Replication is the means by which one or more MySQL <br />
databases can keep data synchronized with a master server. The scope of      <br />
replicated data can cover any range, whether a single table, or              <br />
indiscriminately all the databases on the master server. MySQL Replication is<br />
beginning to find progressively more exposure in corporate production        <br />
environments, where it sees use from providing hot backups, to distributing  <br />
access load amongst large numbers of users. Solomon Chang will cover four main 
topics:                                                                      <br />
<em> Requirements of MySQL Replication                                        <br />
</em> Concepts of MySQL Replication                                            <br />
<em> Configuring MySQL Replication                                            <br />
</em> Troubleshooting MySQL Replication                                          </p>
<p>Soloman will provide a master to replicate from, so attendees are encouraged <br />
to bring their own computers running MySQL (4.1 or later, please) to configure 
as a hands-on slave. Attendees will also have full access to Solomon's master. 
If there is time, more advanced topics will be discussed:                    <br />
<em> Pyramid Architectures                                                    <br />
</em> Dual Masters                                                             <br />
<em> Circular Replication                                                     <br />
</em> Circular Replication of Masters                                            </p>
