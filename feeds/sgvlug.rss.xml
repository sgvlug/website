&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many good, experienced high-level language programmers do not learn C or C++
well until they suddenly need to write an FFI extension, make an emergency
patch to an existing C or C++ codebase, re-implement the bottleneck component
in the application stack in a fast language, take an attractive job with a
low-level programming component, or otherwise move from their comfortable
language of choice and swallow the Red Pill of coding closer to the machine.
If you are already a programmer, you don't need to be taught how to program,
and your google-fu is strong for looking up detailed syntax.  Instead, this
will be a crash course in leveraging skills you learned in a high-level
environment and transferring them to these low-level tools, acquiring some new
skills you simply never needed before, and a building a mental picture of
where the road to expert, idiomatic mastery lies.  We will focus on plain C
because C++ is too complex to cover well in a single talk, but much of the
material will apply directly to C++.  Perhaps surprisingly, some of  it will
even make you a better programmer in your favorite comfortable,  higher-level
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some little-known facts about Dustin Laurence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His first exposure to computers was playing Colossal Cave&lt;br /&gt;
Adventure and the bootleg Fortran IV version of Zork on his cousin's work
mainframe using a glass teletype and a modem with a cradle for the handset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His first good programming language was C.  He lies and pretends that C is where he learned to program because 8-bit BASIC is embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He once gave up trying to learn the libc low-level I/O functions from the Ultrix man pages because he thought a buffer must be some kind of abstract data type provided by the C library and he couldn't find any documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He once confidently predicted that Linux was a temporary fad that would be replaced by BSD for serious work once the Berkeley codebase was completely free.  It's probably a good thing he doesn't gamble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He avoids social media for the same reason he doesn't do crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days he happily hacks Python for Spring Labs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best editor is neither vim nor emacs, it’s Vim and Emacs! Spacemacs is a community-driven Emacs distribution that comes built-in with many popular packages, including Evil-Mode - a vim layer for Emacs, and Org-Mode - a tool for note taking and/or project management that utilizes a rich plain text markup language. This presentation will be a live demo of some of orgmode and spacemacs' features and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

During his undergrad, he project managed a CubeSat program where he developed a passion for space exploration. He worked for an OEM aerospace consulting firm for over a year as an associate mechanical design engineer. In 2015, he joined and collaborated with an online team, performing numerical simulations &amp;amp; control systems design, for rLoop – a non-profit global think tank that won the innovation award for the first SpaceX hyperloop pod competition.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Webhooks and Slack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, Ashok Modi is going to use Slack events as a guide to describe what webhooks are, how they are different from a traditional API, and some of the ways you can deal with data coming from webhooks. This talk will involve looking at code, along with learning about middleware and queues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashok is currently a Software Engineer for the CARD. His primary duties involve working on the core CARD product and intimately working with various technologies to bring their goals to fruition.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claire on Hack for LA&lt;/strong&gt;  The two biggest levers for improving people’s lives at a scale are through technology and government. At Hack for LA, we bring together coders, designers, entrepreneurs, students, government staff, activists, and other civic-minded people to solve the LA region’s biggest challenges through technology. We are a network of people making government work for the people, by the people, in the digital age. Claire will share a brief overview of some civic-hack projects that are currently being built at Hack for LA, which she has been attending for 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claire has many interests but there are two things she always gravitates to: community service and tech! She holds a B.S. in Public Policy and Law from the University of Southern California (Fight on!) and has experience working as an IT Project Coordinator. She is now pursing a career in software development and loves that as a new developer, she can immediately combine her love for community service and computer programming at Hack for LA. On her free time, she volunteers at various tech meetups and conferences. She aims to be part of something bigger than myself by building meaningful technologies that connect people and create communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lan on sed and regular expressions&lt;/strong&gt; Sed is a Linux stream editor that enables text manipulation on the command line. It makes a great introduction to regular expressions, which are used as search patterns to find or find-and-replace text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lan spends the majority of her working hours monitoring and troubleshooting data processing systems on Linux-based computer clusters. She has accumulated a number of tips and tricks to deal with the command line. Her arsenal includes: GNU screen, awk, sed, shell scripting, remote ssh command execution, bash command history, and a variety of system utilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jess on Linux kernel boot process&lt;/strong&gt; Most of us don’t pay attention to the text that scrolls by during bootup, or maybe our distros hide it from us. We know we can dual boot OSes with a menu, but what else does that menu do? We’ll take a brief survey of how the Linux kernel boots, and how GRUB helps configure an appropriate environment for the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jess is a software developer who regularly emcees the SGVLUG meetings and keeps us entertained with a fun spin on Linux in the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Mertz will give a brief overview of PyCon 2019 held in Cleveland, OH. He’ll cover some of the interesting talks, some cool announcements, show off some swag, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About James&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James is a Software Assurance Engineerng at Jet Propulsion Laboratory by day and author at RealPython.com by night. 
In his spare time he also volunteers as a Scout Master for a local Pasadena Scout Troop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/SGVTech/events/zvpphlyzhbmb/"&gt; &lt;img alt="Meetup Event Page" src="https://www.sgvlug.org/images/meetup_logo_45.png" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">SGVLUG</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2019 19:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.sgvlug.org,2019-05-08:2019/05/08/pycon-2019-a-brief-overview/</guid></item><item><title>ZeroMQ Connect ALL the Things</title><link>https://www.sgvlug.org/2019/04/11/zeromq-connect-all-the-things/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZeroMQ: Connect ALL The Things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing applications in a multi-core, multi-threaded, multiprocess, networked world means communicating between many threads and processes over shared memory, IPC, and the network. This often involves multiple low-level libraries (e.g. most languages’ built-in threading, unix IPC, Berkeley sockets) with different programming paradigms, and may require a potential a scaling bottleneck in the form of a central server or broker to make it all manageable. ZeroMQ claims to be a better alternative, providing a single, higher-level message-passing toolkit across threads, processes, and networks, and languages, and specifically supports decentralized messaging. That should make it a slower, clunkier compromise for any one task, but it claims to be both better and easier to use for any one of those problems than a dedicated library. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, so we’ll examine how it compares to standard threading and networking facilities and see how easily we can just connect all the things like Lego bricks, regardless of type or underlying transport. Of course it wouldn’t be any fun without including some very informal performance smackdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Dustin Laurence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intending to become a programmer ("developer" hadn't been invented by the marketing department yet), Dustin got sidetracked and spent more time than he cares to admit doing theoretical physics, a background filled with continuous mathematics almost entirely irrelevant to computer science. He eventually returned to his original love of software. He avoids social media for the same reason he doesn't do crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

Rover. Any feedback will be extremely helpful. We'll also be talking about
SCaLE, volunteering for SCaLE, and plans for our booth at SCaLE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner begins around 7pm and the presentation will start after most people
have received their food or 8pm, whichever comes first. Buying dinner is
optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trouble with Rovers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPL Open Source Rover is a relatively inexpensive and accessible project
for high school and college classes to exercise mechanical and electronics and
software engineering using parts that could be easily sourced from hobbyist
stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPL beta-tested their build instructions at a few schools and with the SGVHAK
maker group. The ultimate goal was to refine the build instructions and grow a
community of experienced builders to help provide support once the rover
documentation and code were open sourced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover"&gt;https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will go over the experience of the SGVHAK maker group in building the
SGVHAK rover and being inspired to build rovers of our own design. The SGVHAK
maker group built the rover over the period of 3 months while giving JPL
significant feedback and build photos. We diverged from the original design
most significantly in the wheel design, motor selection, and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to exhibit the SGVHAK rover at SCALE, the Caltech Science for
March, and the DTLA Mini Maker Faire. We were recently interviewed for the
Command_Line Heroes podcast. Building rovers is a never-ending process. The
SGVHAK rover itself is always under construction. We have plans to add a robot
arm, pan-tilt webcam, and maybe even lidar. Our members have already started
coming up with their own rover designs and builds. All the code and 3D printer
files are on GitHub. Come join us in our rover-building adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Lan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lan Dang is an Operations Engineer with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
specializing in science data systems operations and large scale data
processing. Her contributions to open source focus on community-building and
evangelism. In her spare time, she is active in the San Gabriel Valley tech
community as a leader of the SGVLUG and its sister group, the SGVHAK hardware
hacking group, mentors new hires at work as well as local high school and
college students, and volunteers with various STEAM groups and events. She is
the volunteer coordinator for the SCALE A/V team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Roger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a double-feature for this month's presentation, both given by new
member Sean Marquez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How (and Why) to Choose an Open Source License&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a common misconception that just because your code is public on GitHub
that it is open source, but unless there is a license in your codebase, then it
is by default copyrighted. This talk will cover an introduction to copyright,
open source, the types of open source licenses, how to go about choosing an
open source license for your project, and why should you choose to open
source your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hitchhiker's Guide to Markdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is the most commonly used lightweight markup language on the internet.
However, lately it has been adopted by the technical writing community as a
solution for writing documentation. This has made a lot of people very angry and
been widely regarded as a bad move.&lt;/p&gt;

barrier of entry and inspiring creativity for STEAM education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I was monitoring a server room's temperature, but getting tired of going to
the room every, single, time. I used Arduino to create a device that would do
the job for me. However, it involved messy wiring, dangerous soldering, and
complicated coding. And so an idea was born. I wanted to create something that
anyone could use to imagine a product and immediately just build it. The very
first set of Microduino modules was designed to lower the barriers to
creativity for everyone. We're giving people the freedom to give shape to
their ideas."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company creates the world's smallest Arduino-compatible smart modules.
These modules are flexible, stackable and powerful, and can be used to create
a limitless amount of DIY projects for all ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, Bin has raised over $500,000 across four Microduino crowdfunding
projects and built up Microduino's community from 0 to 1,000,000+ members and
students. Bin is dedicated to making Microduino a significant international
success by creating an educational platform that fits seamlessly into the
global STEM/STEAM education discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bin Feng is the Co-Founder and CEO of Microduino, an international company of
makers and creators aimed at bringing easy-to- use electronics hardware to
makers, designers, engineers, students and curious tinkerers of all ages and
levels. Microduino presents the world's smallest series of Arduino-compatible

better code. If you enjoy these types of talks, please see Michael and Carlos
afterwards about more meetups on good software design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript, like all computer languages, has its flaws. It at times subtly
encourages programmers to commit unabsolvable crimes against the computing
world. It drags new programmers into the abyss of bad practice with the
madness of Lisp and the folly of QuickBasic. Together we shall journey into
the darkness surrounding JavaScript and shine our light into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees should expect to learn a bit about the downside to JavaScript and
some of the bad practices that arise. We will then improve our JavaScript code
by establishing good patterns using modern JavaScript and an understanding of
software design principles. If nothing else attendees shall be thoroughly
entertained, and all will rag on JavaScript just a wee bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Starch in an Engineer. He has used JavaScript professionally for many
years, and has committed every sin in JavaScript's tomb of Evil. He has often
searched for order amongst the chaotic statements of JavaScript, and brings
his methods for your consideration. He is by no means an authority on
JavaScript, but he will step up and speak with authority anyway. You shall be
entertained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My code is available online on github.com so it's open source". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that really true ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to cover what does it mean to be truly open source, including topics like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivations to go open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What, why, how and when to be open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building and sustaining a community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sujen, an open source enthusiast, got involved with contributing to open source projects 
while pursuing his masters at USC and currently works at JPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a member of the Apache Software Organization and in the Project Management Committee 
(PMC) of Apache Nutch and Apache OODT projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years he has been involved with contributing towards open source 
efforts within JPL and projects at DARPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chime Hart will present on using Linux while blind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to explain a 25-year journey of using computers while blind.
In reality, a better way of understanding would be just navigating with only keyboard-and-speech for an hour or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will go over the challenges and the many joys along the way - from discovering DOS, being dragged through windows, and finally 15 years as a Linux user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to any questions along the way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--
Chime worked 35 years at GTE/Verizon, originally helping them with inconsistencies in dialing related with translations.
He is an 'extreme news-junkie', and enjoys diverse types of music.
Earlier he did some College Radio in New Jersey and Boston. Radio has always been in his blood, especially formatics and many jingles.&lt;/p&gt;

Everbridge is also sponsoring food and drink. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software lifecycle does not end when the developer packages their code
and makes it ready for deployment. The delivery of this code is an integral
part of shipping a product. Infrastructure orchestration and resource
configuration should follow a similar lifecycle (and process) to that of
the software delivered on it. In this talk, we will discuss how to use
Terraform and Ansible for automating your infrastructure and software
delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-Code tool for building, managing and
versioning your infrastructure. It allows you to provision and orchestrate
your resources effectively while ensuring that all your resources
configured the way you defined in your code. We will see a practical
example of deploying a complete AWS environment using Terraform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible is an automation tool that excels at configuration management and
application deployment. We will use Ansible and AWX (the open source
version of Ansible Tower) to configure our resources, deploy
applications and perform patch management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPEAKER:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rami is a virtual member of SGVLUG and the DevOps technical lead for
Endpoint Protection Cloud products at Symantec Corporation where he works
on building, deploying and managing security infrastructure and services on
AWS. Also, he is an outspoken advocate of Open Source Software, tools and

tools written by this month's speaker, Dima Kogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNIX shell is a useful environment to get work done. There're a number of
standard, simple tools that talk to each other via a universal interface: the
pipeline. This talk focuses on methods to manipulate and visualize data
directly in the shell, without moving to specialized environments (numpy,
matlab, etc). Specifically I will demonstrate and describe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;feedgnuplot&lt;/em&gt; - a tool plot data coming in on STDIN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;vnlog&lt;/em&gt; - a toolkit to read, write and manipulate columnar ASCII data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are independent tools that are useful standalone, but with shell
piping are EXTRA useful together and in conjunction with other standard
UNIX tools. This unification of data processing and normal shell usage
enable powerful workflows that are otherwise unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPEAKER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dima Kogan - Robotics Engineer, Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dima is a long-time user and contributor to various Free Software projects. He
lives in the shell inside Emacs on his Debian box, and is constantly looking
for ways to save keystrokes. He plays with robotics tools during the day, and
tries to give away as much of his work as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

JPL Open Source Rover.  SGVHAK is one of the beta build groups for this project, so we have lots
to discuss and show off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPL Open Source Rover is an open source robotics project aimed at STEM education at the high school level. 
The robot is designed to have the same mechanical suspension and steering mechanism that the Mars rovers employ. 
This project teaches many aspects that go into robotics, with aspects in mechanical and electrical 
design/engineering, and software development. At this point we have had a few beta test groups on our build 
instructions, and after refienment of those are quickly approaching the release date. Eric will be talking

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source is vital towards our future in technology development and is being
promoted across government institutions and within the private sector. In this
talk he will cover the who, what, where, why, and how's of open source based
on his life experience. This talk will seek to inform and recruit the audience
to engage and contribute in open source by providing answers to the simple
questions. Together we will discuss lowering the barrier to entry into the
open source world. And if you're already contributing to open source then we
will share life experiences and camaraderie and plans to infect more people
with the open source bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical AWK - AWKwardly Dealing with Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWK is a text processing programming language developed at Bell Labs in the
1970s. It was originally used for data extraction and reporting. It inspired
the creation of Perl and can, for the most part, be replaced by Python. It is
still incredibly useful on the Linux command-line, both for one-liners or for
short, powerful scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people have used AWK in one way or another, but they use it without
understanding the language. AWK syntax can seem strange. But once you
understand that it is a data-driven pattern action language where the data is
automatically parsed into predefined variables, it becomes a powerful and
intuitive tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk seeks to take the mystery out of AWK by giving a quick introduction
to the language and its features. There will be examples where it provides
functionality that a dedicated utility like grep or cut or head might not.
There will also be more complex examples where a few lines of AWK result in
useful summarization of large amounts of raw data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWK is a great Swiss Army knife if you spend a lot of time on the command-
line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lan Dang Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lan Dang is an Operations Engineer with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
specializing in science data systems operations and large scale data
processing. She spends most of her time on the command line of various remote
Linux systems. Her favorite tools are screen, awk, vim, and git. In her spare
time, she is active in the San Gabriel Valley tech community as a leader of
the SGVLUG and its sister group, the SGVHAK hardware hacking group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/SGVTech/events/246506476/"&gt; &lt;img alt="Meetup Event Page" src="https://www.sgvlug.org/images/meetup_logo_45.png" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">SGVLUG</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2018 19:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.sgvlug.org,2018-01-11:2018/01/11/practical-awk-awkwardly-dealing-with-data/</guid></item><item><title>26 years of teaching Unix/Linux</title><link>https://www.sgvlug.org/2017/12/14/26-years-of-teaching-unixlinux/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unix Operating System has been around since the 1960s and has provided the
backbone for the modern "Internet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the Unix and Linux experience is the command line shell. This
powerful text based interface can be leveraged to automate tasks and solve
problems that would be too tedious to tackle.  The Born Again Shell is
available on all Unix and Linux platforms.  A clear understanding of the
features of the shell along with a basic set of commands can improve your
productivity and change the way you implement solutions to text based
problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric will provide an overview of how his Unix/Linux classroom has evolved over
26 years.  From the blackboard handwritten lecture in a room without computers
to modern classroom with a computer on every desk.  Through it all, the common
set of command line capabilities has remained a staple in the Unix/Linux
mindset.  sed, grep, cut, tr, and awk are tools that can be combined to
transform the simplest of users into a "Power User".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Danielson was first exposed to FORTRAN as part of a Saturday high school
program at JPL.  Before that, he hadn't been exposed to computers except for
watching his father open up a briefcase sized modem to transfer files using
the house phone handset.  The Saturday class would walk onto the JPL campus
and sit at someone's desk to log into a VAX terminal to edit, compile and run
FORTRAN77 code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric has since earned a B.S. in General Engineering from Harvey Mudd College
and a M.S. in Computer Science from USC.  Eric started working at JPL as a
summer student.  At that time, he was running radiative transfer code
(FORTRAN) and supporting a science team.  After the brand new Sun Microsystem
workstations were installed in the Science Division computer lab, Eric took
some evening classes at Glendale College that included C Programing and Unix
Shell Programming.  Soon after, a co-worker and mentor at JPL encouraged Eric
to take over his teaching workload at Glendale College.  An increase in his
JPL travel schedule was making it difficult to continue teaching. Eric started
teaching BASIC Programming and FORTRAN in 1989.  He eventually took over the
Unix class and has since added the Unix/Linux System Administration class to
the Glendale College curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric is currently the Science Data System (SDS) System Engineer for the Multi-
angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on the Terra Earth Observing
System satellite and the Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) instrument
currently in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric enjoys tinkering with Raspberry Pis and Arduinos in the creative realm of
"Makers".  His recent projects include a portable air quality monitor and a
time-lapse camera with a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk &lt;a href="http://christinecorbettmoran.com/"&gt;Dr. Corbett Moran&lt;/a&gt; will discuss the challenges 
and rewards of instructing a mixed skill class in an apprenticeship style learning environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 26-August 4, 2017 she led a summer program, &lt;a href="http://summerappspace.com/"&gt;Summer App Space&lt;/a&gt;, 
for LA students and teachers to learn programming while getting paid to do fun space-related projects. Her work on
this was supported by NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
award AST-1501208. Summer App Space is a paid apprenticeship where high school
students are paid to attend a six week school learning to program in Python
and the fundamentals of Linux, 20 hours per week. Four weeks are lecture and
lab based, and the last two weeks are project based incorporating a deliverable product and entrepreneurial style teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Corbett Moran is the lead curriculum designer, recruiter and instructor
for the Summer App Space (SAS) 2017 program. She brings to the table extensive
experience in running such programs from a teaching, technology,
organizational, scientific and industry connection perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She taught introductory and advanced courses in MIT MEET: Middle East
Education Through Technology for two summers. MEET is a gifted high school
program in which she taught Java programming and mobile app development in a
project, lecture, and guest speaker format. MEET's mission is creating a
common professional language between Israeli and Palestinian young leaders.
Dr. Corbett Moran served as the lead technical instructor in MIT's Global
Startup labs in the Philippines for a summer to students from a variety of
backgrounds and socio-economic status in the Manila area in a highly similar
format to that planned for SAS. She has organized speakers and technology for
TEDxZurich as well as hackathons for Open WhisperSystems and a site of the
NASA Space Apps Challenge, on which she is basing SAS projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Corbett Moran dually majored in Physics and Computer Science at MIT,
obtained a Master's and Ph.D. focusing on Computational Astrophysics at UZH,
and her NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship research is at
the intersection of the two. She has worked for SpaceX as an intern in
Propulsion Analysis and has over 10 years of industry programming experience
in cutting-edge web and mobile technologies. Dr. Corbett Moran has served as a
teaching assistant and lab assistant for 8 courses, spoken around the globe as
a highly praised public speaker, and mentored several students. Dr. Corbett
Moran's participation has been enabled by NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics
Postdoctoral Fellowship award AST-1501208.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; is a new and exciting systems programming language promising strong
typing, cost free abstractions, and fearless concurrency. Some of these hard
problems have plagued all programming languages for years. We'll talk about
why Rust helps you think about other programming languages more accurately,
why Rust helps you communicate with your team, and how you can help test some
actual Rust code every day to help the Mozilla foundation improve Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I told you that most or all nontrivial C and C++ programs you have ever
written were just illusions? Most such programs contain undefined behavior, and
undefined behavior is at the heart of most C and C++ security problems, yet few
programmers understand how far down that rabbit hole goes. We will swallow the
red pill and study the nature and extent of undefined behavior in C and C++,
techniques for writing more secure, reliable C and C++ in spite of the reality
of undefined behavior and other mischief, and little-used compiler flags and
other tools to detect and/or eliminate bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dustin Laurence Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intending to become a programmer ("developer" hadn't been invented by the
marketing department yet), Dustin got sidetracked and spent more time than he
cares to admit doing theoretical physics, a background filled with continuous
mathematics almost entirely irrelevant to computer science. He eventually
returned to his original love of programming, and though they probably won't
admit it currently hacks code for Whitemoon Dreams, Inc.  He avoids social
media for the same reason he doesn't do crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many strengths of Linux is that it runs on commodity hardware from
an extensive PC ecosystem. We have the freedom to assemble components in a way
that is customized for our own specific needs. And now we can easily continue
our customization to the physical form factor, thanks to recent advances
lowering the cost of fabrication technologies like 3D printing and laser
cutting. Not just the cosmetic art of the "case mod" audience, either:
motivated tinkerers can build functionally useful creations and share them
with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will walk through several custom computer projects, starting with the
"Luggable PC" seen at recent SGVLUG meetups. Each project has its own
motivation, design constraints, and undergo several iterations to refine the

&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi has become a favorite of Amateur Radio operators world-wide.
Although most of the development on projects is occurring outside of the
United States, there are a significant number of products and hacks available.
Repeater controllers, VOIP servers, and even turning your Pi into a
transceiver is possible and is being done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NASA World Wind is an open source virtual globe that makes it easy to build 3D
geospatial applications. World Wind provides APIs for Java, Android, and
JavaScript, and includes a powerful set of capabilities for visualizing and
interacting with spatial data and imagery. In the first part of this
presentation I will discuss some the main features of World Wind, as well as
the World Wind team's development philosophy. The second part of the evening
will be an interactive workshop, in which we will build a simple geo
application using the Web World Wind JavaScript API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enterprises have learned that Open Source is the way to develop great and mature 
software. Leveraging open source tools and packages allows the enterprise to go to 
market faster and have stronger applications. Therefore, using Open Source tools 
is a no brainer for developers. The lawyers on the other hand don’t see it the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker had the privilege of working with the Open Source approval and review 
process in a large security firm. In this talk, he will share lessons learned from 
this process and some best practices that developers should do to make the Enterprise 
Lawyers happy as much as the developers are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each organization that uses Open Source software – even in an unedited form – has a list 
of FOSS licenses that are acceptable and some that are not. Also, has strict requirements 
on how to handle the software and how to incorporate it in the distribution of the 
company’s products. In this talk, we go through some of the lessons learned and pitfalls 
that some Open Source packages have, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not inserting a copyright clause in project code or homepage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking the user to alter the code in order to change the license from GPL to MIT, for example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using dependencies that could be outdated or have CVE’s against it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not providing enough information to build the code from scratch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protecting your digital identity, passwords, and browsing activity is
difficult in the world of open Wifi networks, freeware, and advanced
advertising techniques based on tracking users across the web. While complete
privacy is not possible while connected to the internet, there are many things
you can do to make access to your personal data more difficult. This
presentation will focus on the basics of internet security, how to begin
protecting your network and your data, and why it's so important. We will
focus on the two most prominent (and easiest to fix) security vulnerabilities:
encrypting your browsing on external networks using OpenVPN, and blocking
advertising and tracking as early as possible using Pi-Hole.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open science movement calls for open sharing of research findings and
greater trust, transparency, and reuseability in making claims and reporting
results. A researcher-to-researcher training community known as Carpentry
(Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and others) has emerged to prepare
researchers to practice open science using more open and collaborative
practices; open source tools; and openly licensed and distributed methods,
data, code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this program, the Head of Research Services at the Caltech Library will
describe the Carpentry movement; illustrate how lesson development and
delivery takes place; and lead participants through a sample interactive
lesson from Data Carpentry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be an interactive lesson.  Please bring a fully charged laptop.&lt;br /&gt;
Installation instructions and lesson outline will be posted ahead of time. 
OpenX has guest wifi.
&lt;strong&gt;We will comment in the Meetup, if there are any updates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Weilgart graciously agreed to be our last-minute substitute with his well-received
"Git Foundations: Basic Concepts and Definitions," which was presented at UUASC and LOPSA-LA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of commands! Hundreds of options! Git has dumbfounded sysadmins and developers alike since its appearance in 2005. And yet, this ingenious software is among the most fantastically useful ever developed. Learn Git from the ground up and the inside out with Git Foundations Training! This talk explores Git’s internals in depth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Weilgart has loved maths and computers all his life. Graduating high school at the age of 13, he thereafter worked in a variety of positions including software QA, calculus teacher, and graphic design, before resolving to put his love of computers to professional use as a Linux sysadmin and trainer. Mike currently consults at a Fortune 50 company as an automation specialist, and enjoys nothing more than training people to full mastery of their tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave Flynn will share his extensive experience with 3D printing from the past
4 years, as well as his motivations for designing and building his own 3D
printer.  Specifically, his experience is with the RepRap style of 3D
printers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will be short as Dave much prefers answering questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome the 3D printing community--whether they are experts or neophytes--
to share the things they've printed and spark a conversation about what we can
do with 3D printing, how to get started, and how 3D printing can be used for
art, home, hobby, and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text is everywhere but not always in a useful form.  On any given day we
encounter dozens or hundreds of data formats.  Some formats are focused on
presentation while others focus on structure at the expense of presentation.
Many times the information we need has to be found, disentangled and
manipulated before it is useful.  The easier we can navigate across these
boundaries, the more freedom we have to find new uses and insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux offers a rich array of commands and tools for text processing at the
command line.  This talk proposes a classification for different types of
command line processing tasks and then explores some of the common tools
available within each category.  Many of these tools have a host of options.
Some useful but lesser known options will be highlighted.  The tools will then
be applied to a number of examples covering data extraction, processing and
presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Steres spends most of his time at the command prompt.  He is still amazed
at how small specialized building blocks can be combined to achieve big
results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do amateur radio operators, small businesses, giant corporations, E911 
systems, and Linux hobbyists all have in common?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, besides using Linux, they all are using an application called Asterisk, 
in one of its many forms, to handle telecommunications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amateur radio operators can interlink plain old telephone systems with repeaters, 
small businesses can appear to the world to be a large corporation with custom 
interactive voice response menus, and hobbyists can lower their home phone bill 
to as little as a $1.00 per month with $0.0015/minute call charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention to have a phone number virtually anywhere in the world termin
ate at your home,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will introduce Asterisk, its applications, basic Python scripting, 
and many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Wilkinson holds a PhD in Computer Science from Durham University, one of 
England’s foremost, and third oldest, universities. His also holds undergraduate 
degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Physics as well as a 
Master of Science in Applied Mathematics. During the course of his career, he has 
worked for a “think tank” doing mathematical modeling, then the U.S. Navy, thins 
the senior civilian, and reserve, for one of the largest police departments in 
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now he is a Professor of Computer Science at Pasadena City College. He holds and 
Extra Class amateur radio license and is very active within the hobby as well as 
integrating Linux and amateur radio into one cohesive unit. &lt;/p&gt;

history on P2P software technology, applications and implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The P2P and the World of Tomorrow presentation will address a brief history on
the development on P2P software technology, applications and implementations
by the end user. Applications such as Audio Galaxy, Napster, Direct Connect,
Gnutella, Freenet, eDonkey2000, Kazaa, Morpheus, BitTorrent and Soulseek will
be discussed in the presentation. End user usage patterns based on net
cultural behavioral norms will be addressed as well as the development of
conflict as result of practicing such norms on a end user case-by-case basis.
Media attention and changes in policies of governance in relation to P2P
technology and usage are topics that will be touched on in the presentation.
New changes in P2P technology being made to maneuver difficulties that have
arisen from changes in governance policies are addressed later in the
presentation. The presentation's conclusion addresses technological
responsibility and safety practices the audience can use to prevent themselves
from becoming a marginalized end user as in the cases discussed earlier in the
presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many good, experienced high-level language programmers do not learn C or C++
well until they suddenly need to write an FFI extension, make an emergency
patch to an existing C or C++ codebase, re-implement the bottleneck component
in the application stack in a fast language, take an attractive job with a
low-level programming component, or otherwise move from their comfortable
language of choice and swallow the Red Pill of coding closer to the machine.
If you are already a programmer, you don't need to be taught how to program,
and your google-fu is strong for looking up detailed syntax.  Instead, this
will be a crash course in leveraging skills you learned in a high-level
environment and transferring them to these low-level tools, acquiring some new
skills you simply never needed before, and a building a mental picture of
where the road to expert, idiomatic mastery lies.  We will focus on plain C
because C++ is too complex to cover well in a single talk, but much of the
material will apply directly to C++.  Perhaps surprisingly, some of  it will
even make you a better programmer in your favorite comfortable,  higher-level
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some little-known facts about Dustin Laurence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His first exposure to computers was playing Colossal Cave&lt;br /&gt;
Adventure and the bootleg Fortran IV version of Zork on his cousin's work
mainframe using a glass teletype and a modem with a cradle for the handset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His first good programming language was C.  He lies and pretends that C is where he learned to program because 8-bit BASIC is embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He once gave up trying to learn the libc low-level I/O functions from the Ultrix man pages because he thought a buffer must be some kind of abstract data type provided by the C library and he couldn't find any documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He once confidently predicted that Linux was a temporary fad that would be replaced by BSD for serious work once the Berkeley codebase was completely free.  It's probably a good thing he doesn't gamble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He avoids social media for the same reason he doesn't do crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We need to provide a list of names to building security. RSVPs will be capped at 50.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Zhangfan Xing will present webification (w10n), a data
virtualization technology that simplifies use of resources on the web
platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will discuss science data challenges and share his experience on developing
open source solutions for NASA/JPL. In particular, he will use webification
for science (w10n-sci) as an example to demonstrate how one can bring together
a diverse set of data and visualize them, using modern web browser, in a rapid
and effective fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will also introduce the audience to the rich data collections available at
NASA data centers and elaborate on their potential values to web data
innovators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhangfan Xing is a technical lead at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  For over
a decade, he has been architecting and developing Information Technology
solutions for many NASA funded mission operations and research projects. He is
specialized in search technology, data analysis, web services and their
application to mission critical information and massive scientific datasets.
His recent work on webification has lead to novel web-based applications that
have had impact on NASA's mission operations and opened doors for the creation

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OnSight is a tool that allows scientists to work on Mars through the power of
virtual reality. The Mars terrain displayed in OnSight is produced from real
images sent back by the Curiosity rover, and rendered at 1:1 scale, as if the
user were actually standing on Mars. Behind this exciting user experience is a
powerful backend infrastructure that continually produces 3D terrain
reconstructions as new images are sent back by the Curiosity rover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terrain build system automatically detects when new images are available,
dynamically starts and stops computing instances to handle the workload, and
presents dashboards to view the progress of terrain builds. The system runs on
Amazon's cloud services platform, using a mix of Linux and Windows virtual
computing instances. The system leverages a variety of open source projects
including NodeJS, LoopBack, Ansible, Jenkins, AngularJS, and BootStrap. In
this talk will focus on the cloud computing aspects of the terrain system,
rather than on image processing. I will present a detailed look at the parts
of this system, and discuss the team's experience adapting a desktop data
processing workflow to a cloud architecture. Please join me for an applied
look at how data processing challenges can be addressed in a cloud computing
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liz Krane started the Learn to Code LA meetup group in 2015, and with
perseverance and some luck, the community grew to over 2200 members in less
than a year. In this talk, she will share what she learned by building a
community from scratch in a field she knew nothing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you build a community? From small open-source projects to international
movements, communities amplify our individual motivations and enable us to
create meaningful changes in the world. And on a personal level, communities
are essential for our well-being as social animals. What makes for a
successful community, and how do you persuade other people to get involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz Krane is the founder of Learn to Code LA, a community that introduces new
people to computer science and programming with classes and fun events.Liz is
a professional dabbler who dreams of learning something about everything.
Previously a research assistant at USC Annenberg, she currently works as a
freelance web developer, writer, photographer and designer, exploring the
intersections between technology, education and journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 7:30pm, we'll start the meeting with LUG business and Linux in the
News.  The talk will start shortly afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we didn't get to raffle off much stuff at our booth at SCALE, we'll be
doing some raffles during the next few meetings.  We will draw for the raffle
before and after the talk.  You will get a raffle ticket just for showing up.
You may earn extra raffle tickets for audience participation.&lt;/p&gt;

talk&lt;/a&gt; on DNSSEC.
Why should you care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"DNSSec is an absolute requirement if we want to ... use the Internet for anything non-trivial." - Cricket Liu, Leading expert on the Domain Name System (DNS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Internet needs this technology and it needs it now" - Vint Cerf, Father of the Internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is arguably one of the most important security improvements to the Internet ever." -Steve Crocker, Internet Pioneer and Chair of the Board of ICANN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS (Domain Name System) is used by everyone who is a consumer of the Internet. It is a core component of the Internet, yet it is completely insecure. This puts us all at risk. DNSSEC offers a solution to address the vulnerabilities of DNS . For this reason I hope stir up demand and motivation to deploy DNSSEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will go over the basic of DNS and its vulnerabilities. Then we will go over how DNSSEC works and the solution it provides. As users, we will look at why it is important for our safety to require that our service providers (ISPs, Registrars, Hosted Services (banking, commerce, etc)) provide DNSSEC. And we will also look at some user-end tools available to advantage of DNSSEC today.  We will go over reasons why companies would want to make the effort and investment. For sysadmins, we will go over tools to aid with deployment and some considerations  to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its essence, DNS translates names, that humans understand, to IP addresses, that computers understand. This is how we are able to find other computers on the Internet (webpages, email servers, etc). But DNS does not provide a way to validate the answer we receive. This exposes all of us to a large vulnerability. Exploits such as DNS hijacking and DNS cache poisoning miss direct us and can lead us to potentially malicious computers. DNSSEC provides a solution to this by allowing authentication of DNS data through a chain-of- trust. Being able to trust DNS goes a long way to creating a safer Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we can trust DNS other things become possible. We can now leverage DNS to store other information such as cryptographic keys. This means we can store and trust self signed SSL certificates in DNS because it is now a trusted source. This eliminates the need for certificate authorities and the issues with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNSSEC is a great improvement on a fundamental component of the Internet we
all us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biography:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlos has worked many years as a system administrator. His interest include InfoSec, site reliability and automation, and open source development.  While volunteering as an Interop Team Member, he was introduced to the significance of DNSSEC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biography:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/matthew-campbell/13/734/495"&gt;Matt Campbell&lt;/a&gt; has been active in technology and electronics since the late 80s in a variety of roles.  His background spans technical expertise in Unix OS and kernel design, the marriage of art and technology in feature film special effects, and delivery of solutions on cloud, database, virtualized, and mobile platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt's first company was founded on principles similar to modern dev-ops practices.  Defining the data structures of DVD authoring by developing a language describing the desired layout and interaction allowed the studio to deliver products for a fraction of the cost of competitors while supporting interactivity unavailable to the major studios at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently a corporate technology strategist, he is defining services for a post cloud world with a 200,000-employee organization facing billion dollar technology budgets and rapid growth.&lt;/p&gt;

crypto"&gt;SCALE 13x
talk&lt;/a&gt;.   We'll also be talking about the SGVLUG BBQ for September, the 20th
anniversary party plans for November, and SCALE 14x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of how cryptographic algorithms are designed, implemented,
verified, and assembled into cryptosystems requires expert knowledge.
Fortunately, the big picture of how the resulting cryptosystems are used does
not. For most users and even most programmers, the underlying algorithms are
black boxes that they do not and need not understand, while the language and
conceptual framework of modern cryptography are very useful in putting those
algorithms to practical use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will sketch out that conceptual framework at action-movie speed using the
simplest of classical cryptographic algorithms to represent the modern black
boxes for concreteness while studing everything but the algorithms themselves.
After the presentation you should understand: elementary cryptographic
language, security as a probabalistic rather than absolute guarantee, why the
size of the keyspace matters, why practical security depends on choosing keys
randomly, what side-channel attacks are, what public-key cryptography is, and
what a digital signature is. You should also have the basic conceptual
framework and vocabulary for further study or self-study. The presentation
should be accessible to beginners of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biography:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intending to become a programmer ("developer" hadn't been invented by the
marketing department yet), Dustin got sidetracked and spent more time than he
cares to admit doing theoretical physics, a background filled with continuous
mathematics almost entirely irrelevant to computer science and cryptography.
He eventually returned to his original love, and these days writes
cryptographic and embedded software for Gem, Inc. He believes that every
programmer and indeed every citizen must be cryptographically literate in the
world he and many, many others are busy creating. He avoids social media for
the same reason he doesn't do crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The learner will use the Logitech wireless keyboards, observing the eccentricities resulting from the Desknet decoding strategies.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The learner will demonstrate proficiency in addition and multiplication by engaging in real-time competitive activies with his/her peers.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The learner will recognize and appropriately place his/her fingers on the home row keys, and will gain speed and accuracy in reaching for non-home- row letters.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The learner will use the Desknet system to check his/her written calculations derived from the 3rd grade math text.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The learner will create and edit coherent text, using the Desknet word processor.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The learner will anecdotally recount the development of the Desknet hardware and system code to peers as occasion demands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biography:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John  Slayton is a native of Kansas City (Missouri side), but mostly grew up in California.  He received an MA from UCLA in Linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 80's he became increasingly dissatisfied with his kids' experience in the public schools and went back to school (Cal Poly Pomona)  to get a California teaching credential.  He tried to get a job with El Monte City Schools, and wound up spending the next 21 years teaching bilingual classes at LeGore School.  His class  became his lab in which he could try new things, not all of which turned out well.  But some worked.  The Desknet project is one of these.&lt;/p&gt;

technology have made publishing more accessible than ever. The opportunities
in traditional and independent publishing are wide open.  But writing a book
remains a daunting task, and new authors will encounter many steps along the
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it take to publish information in the digital age?  Hybrid author
Nathan Haines discusses working with traditional publishers that use
proprietary software and formats, and describes the self-publishing process
from start to finish.  From ebooks to print, is Free and Open Source Software
up to the task?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biography:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Haines is an author, instructor, and computer consultant who fell in
love with Ubuntu in 2005, and helped found the Ubuntu California Local
Community Team to share that excitement with others. As a current leader of
the California team and a member of the Ubuntu Local Community Council, he
works to help others support and share Ubuntu worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mission to educate and excite people about Free Software and Ubuntu
continues with his upcoming book, Beginning Ubuntu Linux for Windows and Mac

&lt;p&gt;Docker is a hot trend in today's tech community, making it easier than ever to
containerize and deploy modern, and legacy software applications.  While often
mistaken for virtualization, containers take a new, lightweight approach to
abstracting and isolating the runtime environment, dependencies and networking
required by modern software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover how to get started with Docker, best practices for
containers and example workflows for developing and deploying containers
locally and in cloud environments. After this talk you should have the
essential building blocks for building a containerized environment and
application stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Hamilton will go over the basics of Ansible and discuss why it's a
great tool for running simple commands, complex tasks and workflows across a
group of systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible is a powerful but simple automation tool. Ansible is simple enough
that most developers and administrators will be able to understand the scripts
without much trouble. With this simplicity, Ansible is great for organizations
looking for a tool that both dev and ops can use together. The YAML based
syntax of Ansible is also much easier to understand than the DSL that some
other tools use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew is currently a Systems Architect at Prevoty where he focuses on
automation and infrastructure. Previously he was an SRE for Search @Twitter
and a system administrator for Eucalyptus. Andrew is passionate about cloud
computing and automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIRECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Once through the driveway, please park in the 888 Lot that has the OpenX logo displayed out front. Pull a ticket and bring it with you to the Meet-Up, we will validate your parking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/6/4/8/600_413018472.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE ON ANSIBLE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible has many features common to configuration management systems such as
Puppet and Chef. Ansible uses a simple execution model compared to Puppet and
Chef that is much easier for new users to understand. The majority of the
modules it provides are indepotent so a playbook can be run multiple times
without causing problems by running a change multiple times if it isn't
needed. The use of YAML to describe your playbooks also makes creating and
editing Ansible playbooks much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interacting directly with services such as AWS, GCE, Azure or OpenStack is
easy through a set of provided modules. Ansible allows you to create an entire
deployment framework with one tool that can provision hosts, configure and
install software, add and remove servers from a load balancer and finally
terminate the old instances. Ansible can also use dynamically generated lists
of hosts making it easy to work in highly dynamic environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful features of Ansible is that hosts are accessed over
SSH. There is no need to install additional daemons or to open up additional
ports. You can simply write a playbook, give it a set of hosts to run against,
provide a set of credentials and watch Ansible do what you've told it to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also don't need to give Ansible access to root unless it is required for
the playbook. Ansible can use either sudo or su to escalate privileges for
single tasks or entire playbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible core is written in Python so it's easy to run and extend. If Python is
your language of choice, Ansible provides you with a set of modules that make
writing your own modules easy. If you're not a Python developer, Ansible
allows modules to be written in any language that can accept JSON through
STDIN and then return JSON back to through STDOUT. Ansible can also be used as
a library in Python that allows you to easily take advantage of some of its
features in custom scripts. Ansible is a flexible tool that allows users to
easily perform both adhoc remote command execution and configuration
management across a group of hosts. Getting started with Ansible is easy and
has relatively low overhead. Ansible playbooks are simple enough that they can
be compared with shell scripts. We'll go over the basics of Ansible and
discuss why it's a great tool for running simple commands, complex tasks and
workflows across a group of systems.&lt;/p&gt;

traditional big-data processing and management systems. It is based on an open
source data processing framework called OODT (Object Oriented Data Technology)
and was funded by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Big Data Research &amp;amp;
Technology Development initiative "Archiving, Processing and Dissemination for
the Big Data Era". The vision behind the project is to combine state-of-the-
art technologies into an easy-to-use big-data processing system prepackaged to
allow users to quickly process big-data without the need to patch together
individual technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streaming-OODT provides both traditional batch processing as well as in-memory
MapReduce processing for use on general computing clusters. Cluster management
and multi-tenancy is provided via Apache Mesos, which manages batch processing
as well as the Streaming-OODT's underlying technologies. This ensures that
multi-tenancy is applied to both the system and the user's processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache Spark provides in-memory MapReduce processing enabling processing at
speeds hundreds of times faster than Hadoop MapReduce. This system is
augmented by Apache Kafka used to manage streaming data. This enables the user
to process streaming data alongside traditional data in Apache Spark and thus
tackle data-sets too large to persist en-masse to disk, while not losing the
ability to process data sets that already exist on disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tachyon, an in-memory distributed file system, provides lightning-fast
distributed access to data files and streams on all nodes of the cluster.
Persistence is provided by Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) thus allowing
the user both fast data access and persistence to disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this talk is to demonstrate Streaming-OODT, which will enable
the audience to use Streaming-OODT and supporting technologies to quickly
tackle their own big-data problems. The talk will introduce Streaming-OODT,
show how to quickly install and configure the system, explain the value added
by the underlying technologies, and walk through a working example of big-data
processing. Finally, benchmarks will be presented so that the audience can see
the benefit of these technologies and their combination.&lt;/p&gt;

Model for the Open Source Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2011, Droplabs is a coworking space, classroom and makerspace in
Downtown Los Angeles. Our community is made up of members who support each
other personally and professionally in a positive environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coworking services and developer programs we offer, like Free Coworking
Days, Coders with a Cause, Mobile Device Lab and Developer Boot Camps, were
made possible because of our love of open source and a passion for learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd love to see more places like Droplabs, and we're happy to talk at SGVLUG
about how others can replicate our success - and avoid or overcome the
challenges we've had over the years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying a space to build a location-based community  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic and parking in Downtown Los Angeles  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making decisions in a consensus-based organization  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empowering members to become leaders  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disrupting the coworking business model  &lt;/li&gt;

He has hollowed out a film camera and put in a Raspberry Pi, camera, and some other electronics to make a retro-looking camera that actually takes digital photos -and- allows ssh access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had close-up pictures of the electronic components and detailed explanations of why he chose a particular component, why he modified it, and how it fit into the project. James' particular focus was on energy efficiency, so he went through a lot of trouble to modify the board to use 3.3v power from a cellphone battery.  He also looked for low-power components and ways to save power.  Because there is no leds or lcd, he used beeps to provide feedback from the camera during operation.  He also has a six-position knob that allows him to do things like turn on the system, turn off the camera portion, or to send the halt command to the Raspberry Pi.  There is room for more features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has set up a webserver on the Raspberry Pi using nginx and Flask.  This allows access to the photos on the Pi.  Aside from a serial connection and the controls from the camera, the only way to "talk" to the Raspberry Pi is through the webserver or ssh.  The Raspberry Pi is set up to automatically connect to known networks in the wpa supplicants file.  The actual camera operation is handled through a Python library called &lt;a href="https://picamera.readthedocs.org/en/release-1.5/"&gt;picamera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">SGVLUG</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 12:48:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.sgvlug.org,2014-07-09:2014/07/09/raspberry-pi-retro-camera/</guid></item><item><title>Data Roads, Data Flow Centric Networks, and DaFODeL</title><link>https://www.sgvlug.org/2014/06/04/data-roads-data-flow-centric-networks-and-dafodel/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After over 12 years trying to get the video games studio industry to both
create and use more open source software and unrestricted hardware, Jared
Hardy finally gave up on those proprietary-minded fools, and started building
NELA-ISC.Net instead. In the process of bootstrapping this Northeast LA
community utility cooperative (still in progress), he discovered the catch-22
of funding nonprofit community projects that can never take any tax deductible
donations or returns-based investments. He then started the deductible-
donation accepting Data Roads Foundation to help solve that catch-22
investment problem -- among other issues inherent to all cooperatively owned
networks. More about that and his other yak shaving projects are available in

The team recently wrapped our "Snow On" campaign where over a course of 3 months, we flew the Tuolumne River Basin, Sierra Nevada, California above the O'Shaughnessy Dam of the Hetch Hetchy reservoir; focusing initial on the Tuolumne, and then moving to weekly flights over the Uncompahgre Basin, Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet the needs of its customers including Water Resource managers who are keenly interested in Snow melt, the ASO team had to develop and end to end 24 hour latency capability for processing spectrometer and LIDAR data from Level 0 to Level 4 ("ish") products. Fondly referring to these processing campaigns as "rodeos" the team rapidly constructed an open source data processing system at minimal cost and risk that not only met our processing demands, but taught the entire team many lessons about remote sensing of snow and dust properties, algorithm integration, the relationship between computer scientists, and snow hydrologist; flight and engineering teams, geographers, and most importantly lessons about camaraderie that will engender highly innovative and rapid data systems development, and quality science products for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Mattmann is the Compute Lead for the ASO project and he will humbly tell the story of the Compute processing capability on behalf of the larger team, highlighting contributions of its key members along the way&lt;/p&gt;

community, Redmine is a full-featured system used by companies, open
source projects, governmental agencies, and individual developers around
the world. Big users of Redmine include open source projects such as
Ruby, Puppet, Gentoo, Lighttpd, TYPO3, and the Redmine project itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will focus on how Redmine is used from the
perspectives of developers, tech leads and project managers at a
software development company. Features that will be demonstrated include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User and group management;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeds, email notifications and web-to-mail and mail-to-web support;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Per-project role-based permissions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time tracking and reports; including calendaring and Gantt charts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue workflow management across multiple roles;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redmine's plug-in architecture and growing developer ecosystem;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom fields for extending user accounts, time entries, and other
data structures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redmine's REST API and how it integrates with third-party platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A modern day Linux Infrastructure should be flexible, scalable and able to deal
with the constant changes any business will require.  Automation is key to a
reliable and consistence server infrastructure, Automation also allows for easy
integration of new changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DevOps movement melds two traditionally siloed teams; Application
Developers and Operations Engineers.  Writing infrastructure as code presents a
number of challenges and potential pitfalls, Operations Engineers need to write
code (something they may not be familar with) and Developers need to have a
strong understanding of the system (many Developers don't want to be considered
with anything other than web applications).  There are several major projects
related purely to the management of infrastructure as code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will examine Opscode Chef and make a strong use case for the implementation
of Opscode Chef in a Linux Environment.  David will demonstrate many techniques
to utilize Chef quickly and efficiently to minimize the time of implementation.
Although Opscode Chef can be run on Solaris, FreeBSD and even Windows, the
presentation will discuss Linux and only Linux.  David will also discuss the
techniques to operate Chef on various Linux Distros which can provide a layer
of abstraction from the package management systems (apt &amp;amp; yum).  Finally David
will discuss how Chef can be used to rebuild an Entire infrastructure
(regardless of size or complexity) in a time previous thought impossible.  The
only limitation in speed of deployment is the hardware.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Presentation will cover the Linux command line utility 'strace' and some of it's many uses.  It will cover the basics of Linux System Calls and their use.  The presentation will use examples throughout to provide genuine use-cases for the tool.  The Presentation is focused on Practical Application Troubleshooting, it will not be an in-depth guide to the various System Calls.  I will demonstrate many techniques that can help you to gain a deeper understanding of application execution flow on a Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like working on hardware projects?  Did you just get a Raspberry Pi/Arduino/Kinect with the intentions of doing something cool?  Did you wish that there was a local meetup group where you can meet up with like-minded folks and actually make progress with your projects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come to our kickoff meeting on Thursday to discuss starting up this special interest group.  Connect with your fellow hardware geeks and share some of the projects you've been working on. And if we can decide on a name for the SIG, we can set up things like a mailing list, website, and wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

lot of infrastructure to set up and it was all due yesterday. If only
you could clone all the sysadmins of the world to get all of their
expertise and know-how in deploying open source applications, you could
actually get it done. Perhaps there is a way: Juju and Charms! Juju
encapsulates services in a way that promotes sharing and collaboration
the same way packages have done for open source software.  If you are
a sysadmin or a developer who is looking to get an infrastructure of
databases, loadbalancers, and webapps up to speed rapidly, Juju may
be interesting. If you are looking into deploying something massively
scalable, like OpenStack or Hadoop, Juju is built to handle that task.&lt;/p&gt;

version 11.04, significantly enhanced with version 11.10, and very much the  &lt;br /&gt;
cornerstone of the upcoming 12.04 release.                                     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A striking departure from Gnome 2, Unity has been seen as a source of        &lt;br /&gt;
controversy in the Linux world.                                                &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will outline some of the design goals that Unity addresses, noting &lt;br /&gt;
strengths, weaknesses, and improvements across the three versions of Ubuntu in 
which it's been included.                                                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Unity offers many usability affordances, some Ubuntu users prefer to   &lt;br /&gt;
customize it for their specific workflows. Linux is famous for its           &lt;br /&gt;
customizability, and Unity is no exception if you know which tools to look   &lt;br /&gt;
for.                                                                           &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will outline some of the tools available through the Ubuntu&lt;br /&gt;
Software Center to show you how to customize the Unity interface.              &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaker Bio: Richard Gaskin is President of Fourth World, a software design  &lt;br /&gt;

1994, he's developed dozens of commercial and open source applications used by 
a wide range of organizations, including FedEx, AOL, the US Library of       &lt;br /&gt;
Congress, and hundreds of universities around the world.                       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although he started his career with Mac OS, Richard has since delivered      &lt;br /&gt;
applications for Irix, every version of Windows, and has been developing for &lt;br /&gt;
Linux for the last two years.                                                  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard has spoken at more than a dozen tech conferences, including UbuCon,  &lt;br /&gt;

lessons to be learned. Depending on how quickly the presentation goes we may &lt;br /&gt;
have time to share more, so please feel free to bring your horror story and  &lt;br /&gt;
what you did to resolve it.                                                    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lan Dang spends the majority of her working hours monitoring and             &lt;br /&gt;
troubleshooting data processing systems on Linux-based computer clusters. She&lt;br /&gt;
has accumulated a number of tips and tricks to deal with the command line. Her 
arsenal includes: GNU screen, awk, sed, shell scripting, remote ssh command  &lt;br /&gt;
execution, bash command history, and a variety of system utilities. This talk&lt;br /&gt;
will cover useful one-liners and the small set of useful commands that will  &lt;br /&gt;
get you started using these tools or using them in new ways. Whether you're a&lt;br /&gt;
newbie or a command line guru, you'll probably pick up something useful for  &lt;br /&gt;
the next time you're at the command line.                                      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Topic: Virtualmin / Webmin + Brief review Defcon/Blackhat:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your Drupal sites to the next level with the free, open-source Webmin   &lt;br /&gt;
control panel and its powerful Virtualmin plug-in. Add as many features as you 
want, including unlimited domains, mail accounts, Subversion repositories,   &lt;br /&gt;
mailing lists, and more with a point-and-click web interface.                  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webmin and Virtualmin are similar to cPanel and WHM, respectively, and can   &lt;br /&gt;
manage dozens or even hundreds of domains. They are the perfect tools for    &lt;br /&gt;
creating test and development sites, hosting client websites or even managing&lt;br /&gt;
a full-blown online infrastructure for running a business.                     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did we forget to mention, Webmin and Virtualmin are free* and open-source?   &lt;br /&gt;
Compared to site licensing costs of cPanel, WHM, Plesk and other proprietary &lt;br /&gt;
control panels, Webmin and Virtualmin cost only as much as a basic           &lt;br /&gt;
$10-20/month VPS account.                                                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bio: ----- Christefano is CEO and Co-founder of Exaltation of Larks, where   &lt;br /&gt;
Virtualmin has been a key ingredient for rapid website deployment. He is a   &lt;br /&gt;
sysadmin for LA Drupal and the DrupalCamp LA website (which uses Virtualmin) &lt;br /&gt;
and has been on the Drupal.org and groups.drupal.org webmaster teams since   &lt;br /&gt;
2008. Exaltation of Larks, which provides Drupal consulting, development and &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APRS is a amateur radio network where small packets of data such as position &lt;br /&gt;
reports, messages or telemetry are transmitted to other radio operators and  &lt;br /&gt;
eventually propagated to the Internet.                                       &lt;br /&gt;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System                 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of small, low power and easily hackable ARM devices opens up 
many possibilities for setting up unobtrusive computing solutions. Amateur   &lt;br /&gt;
radio operator and long time Linux user James McDuffie (K6JLM) explores using&lt;br /&gt;
the Seagate GoFlex Net along with surplus amateur radio equipment to build a &lt;br /&gt;
APRS digipeater for helping to relay packets both over RF and to the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topic: How to program your own smart phone Matthew Campbell and Rae Yip will &lt;br /&gt;
walk us through the steps needed to get a basic "hello world" application on &lt;br /&gt;
an Android phone.                                                              &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew will cover the following: Android programming overview. Installing the 
development environment (Eclipse 3.5.2), the Android SDK and the Eclipse ADT &lt;br /&gt;
development tools. Writing your first hello world application. Compiling and &lt;br /&gt;
emulating the application. Installing the application on your phone. Using the 
Google APIs. Publishing your application.                                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rae will cover more details of the Android operating system including the    &lt;br /&gt;
filesystem layout third party libraries Open Intents                           &lt;/p&gt;

anywhere for under $90                                                         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUMMARY                                                                        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off-line content is reading material, educational texts, and other reference &lt;br /&gt;
materials delivered on media such as SDCards, DVDs, custom hardware, or hard &lt;br /&gt;
drives so that it can be used without internet access. A typical deployment  &lt;br /&gt;
can deliver the equivalent of tens of thousands of printed books. The cost to&lt;br /&gt;
deliver large off-line libraries has fallen below the cost to deliver online &lt;br /&gt;
internet access in most areas. Off-line content thus provides a cost effective 
way to provide access to the world's knowledge before affordable internet    &lt;br /&gt;
infrastructure is available. This presentation reviews six emerging projects &lt;br /&gt;
which aim to provide off-line hardware and libraries, including the author's &lt;br /&gt;
creation, the $20 Humane Reader                                                &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 2010: An open-source 8-bit computer to save the world Braddock is back!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braddock Gaskill will discuss and debut his open source hardware and software&lt;br /&gt;
project designed both for hobbyists and as an e-book reader for developing   &lt;br /&gt;
nations.                                                                       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device can store a 5,000 book library or the better part of Wikipedia and&lt;br /&gt;
display it on any TV set in a developing-world village library - all for under 
$20. It is also a fun general purpose 8-bit computing platform comparable in &lt;br /&gt;
raw capability to the Apple II and built, in part, for experimentation and   &lt;br /&gt;
hobbyists. The entire system is open sourced, and uses GNU toolchain cross   &lt;br /&gt;
development under Linux with heavy OSS throughout.                             &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will work through the design, schematic, PCB fab, assembly, &lt;br /&gt;
and software dev. Braddock will walk the audience through each stage, cover  &lt;br /&gt;
which tools were used, ponder major design considerations, and pay special   &lt;br /&gt;
attention to open source solutions.                                            &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topic: Data Ownership - How I (mostly) wrestled control of my data from evil &lt;br /&gt;
corporate overlords                                                            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaker: Charles N Wyble                                                       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Wyble is a systems and security engineer. His focus in 2010 is       &lt;br /&gt;
security research, with a particular emphasis on improving performance of    &lt;br /&gt;
automated analytic systems. In support of this, he does a lot of networking  &lt;br /&gt;
stuff and is in the process of building a malware lab.                         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lives in sunny southern California, with his wife Patricia and 2 dogs ISIS&lt;br /&gt;
and OSPF. Yes they are named after routing protocols. He frequently hosts    &lt;br /&gt;
hacker parties, where all sorts of cool stuff gets built. You will often find&lt;br /&gt;
him at various hot startups doing consulting, and at numerous user group     &lt;br /&gt;
meetings throughout the southwestern United States.                            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Wyble will be joining the SGVLUG group once again and discussing the &lt;br /&gt;
topic of data ownership / private cloud.                                       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning ones data is a critical and often overlooked part of security. As such, 
he will discuss how he maintains numerous web properties on a Linux server at&lt;br /&gt;
his residence, connected to the best DSL ATT has to offer.                     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has recently completed moving all his data onto his own server, freeing it&lt;br /&gt;
(mostly) from the control of google,yahoo etc. It was a relatively           &lt;br /&gt;
straightforward process, encompassing 4 major phases. He will talk about the &lt;br /&gt;
tools he utilizes, and advantages/disadvantages to his setup and some of the &lt;br /&gt;
problems he encountered.                                                       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three years the speaker ran a small technology startup company developing&lt;br /&gt;
new ways of visualizing and exploring huge datasets, like, for example, the  &lt;br /&gt;
entire routing structure of the internet, or tens of thousands of documents.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover real-world experiences with the broad variety of Open   &lt;br /&gt;
Source software which made the project possible. Dependencies included Boost,&lt;br /&gt;
CMake, OpenSceneGraph, khtml, gecko, Firefox plugins, GraphViz, lighttpd,    &lt;br /&gt;
Xerces DOM, and more. Theses building blocks were in many cases pushed to (and 
beyond) their limits, deployed in a cross-platform Linux and Windows         &lt;br /&gt;
environment, and compiled with GCC and MSVC++. We will cover lessons learned,&lt;br /&gt;

Challenge                                                                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Northrup Grumman Lunar Lander X Prize Challenge, a NASA space competition&lt;br /&gt;
prize contest, is intended to foster the commercial development of a vehicle &lt;br /&gt;
capable of launching from the surface of the moon into lunar orbit and then  &lt;br /&gt;
land back on the moon. Consisting of two levels of difficulty, a prize is    &lt;br /&gt;
given to the 1st and 2nd place winners of each level. Unreasonable Rocket, one 
of three teams that competed at this year's event, attempted to claim purses &lt;br /&gt;
from both competition levels.                                                  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come listen to the team from Unreasonable Rocket share their experience in   &lt;br /&gt;
this year's event.                                                             &lt;/p&gt;

Box), the open-source alternative to TiVo or Windows Media Center. More than &lt;br /&gt;
just a digital VCR, which provides basic "time shifting" capability, Digital &lt;br /&gt;
Video Recorders change the way people watch television by providing the      &lt;br /&gt;
ability to pause live TV, instantly replay interesting scenes, and skip      &lt;br /&gt;
commercials. With an up-to-date TV schedule, the DVR can automatically record&lt;br /&gt;
shows based on user preferences.                                               &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael will talk about his strange MythTV setup and a small portion of      &lt;br /&gt;
MythTV's features including Recording HDTV, streaming to a Cell Phone and    &lt;br /&gt;
using an AppleTV as a MythTV Front-end.                                        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Runs The San Gabriel Valley Linux(R) Users Group (At least he has been 
told that by others). He spends an unhealthy amount of his time watching     &lt;br /&gt;
MythTV and plotting how he can never be without access to MythTV.              &lt;/p&gt;

for the Linksys NSLU2 (Network Storage Link for USB 2.0 Disk Drives) using the&lt;br /&gt;
Unslung Linux firmware replacement. Using an external USB Flash memory for    &lt;br /&gt;
storing the database files, it should be possible to create an application    &lt;br /&gt;
server that is virtually maintenance free.                                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilfred will be here to give a demo of the NSLU2 running BarracudaDrive,      &lt;br /&gt;
including the many practical features of BarracudaDrive and how some users use&lt;br /&gt;
BarracudaDrive for many non traditional Web server tasks.                       &lt;/p&gt;

next San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group. He will present the                &lt;br /&gt;
yet-to-be-released InDaMixx appliance, a full-featured, hand-held recording  &lt;br /&gt;
studio built on Linux (a customized version of 64Studio, to be more specific). 
He will go over topics such as why Linux was chosen, the future of music in  &lt;br /&gt;
the open-source community and will demo some of the great features of        &lt;br /&gt;
InDaMixx.                                                                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronald's background in the music industry goes back to the late 80's as a DJ &amp;amp; 
Remixer for Factor 3 Records, Tommy Boy Records, Bullet Proof Records &amp;amp; one of 
the first beta testers for Digidesign's Pro Tools. Ronald decided that he    &lt;br /&gt;
needed a full-featured device that he could take with him, along with all his&lt;br /&gt;
music only to find out nothing like this existed. Ever the frontiersman,     &lt;br /&gt;
Ronald decided to blaze the trail, chose all open-source applications and    &lt;br /&gt;
hasn't looked back ever since.                                                 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt; Quick Picasa 2.7 for Linux demo. (Picasa is Google's photo management    &lt;br /&gt;
  software for Windows and Linux, but many people don't know about the Linux 
  version)                                                                 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; Quick Wine status report. (Wine is Linux's implementation of Win32; it   &lt;br /&gt;
  lets you run many Windows applications.)                                 &lt;br /&gt;
* Introduction to Zumastor. (Zumastor is Linux's answer to ZFS, kind of; it&lt;br /&gt;
  lets you take atomic snapshots of any filesystem, and easily replicate   &lt;br /&gt;
  those snapshots to remote systems.)                                        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan is a developer for all three projects and was elected the release manager&lt;br /&gt;
for the upcoming 1.0 release of Wine, so feel free to ask all the technical  &lt;br /&gt;
questions you like.                                                            &lt;/p&gt;

distribution, voice mail and interactive voice response menus. X10 is a      &lt;br /&gt;
power-line carrier protocol for controlling lights and appliances. What can  &lt;br /&gt;
you do when you combine them? Claude Felizardo will give us an update on his &lt;br /&gt;
home-automation system and how integrating Asterisk has moved his home closer&lt;br /&gt;
to what is depicted in popular science fiction.                                &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 15 years as a Unix developer, Claude got his start with Linux in the 
late 90s when he built his own firewall. Most of his friends and family think&lt;br /&gt;
he has too many gadgets, but he's always looking for something new to play   &lt;br /&gt;
with, especially if it can be integrated into his system at home. His previous 
presentations include an Intro to Home Automation, Hacking TiVo and Monitoring 
the Weather with Linux.                                                        &lt;/p&gt;

typesetting system and its application to real-world document production. He &lt;br /&gt;
will explain how he uses it in the creation of essays, books, and letters    &lt;br /&gt;
incorporating graphics. He will also demonstrate the use of LaTeX in his     &lt;br /&gt;
band's annual fund drive which requires the creation of personalized letters &lt;br /&gt;
(mail merge) and envelopes.                                                    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially designed to typeset mathematical formulae, the LaTeX system        &lt;br /&gt;
incorporates world-class fonts with international symbols. The system        &lt;br /&gt;
successfully handles the automatic typesetting of complicated textbooks with &lt;br /&gt;
thousands of images and internal page, chapter, and figure references. The   &lt;br /&gt;
line-breaking algorithm used by LaTeX (or more accurately, by the more basic &lt;br /&gt;
TeX engine) is the industry leader (eventually adopted by Adobe for its      &lt;br /&gt;
commercial program, InDesign).                                                 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the presenter:                                                         &lt;br /&gt;
Kris Bergstrom was first exposed to GNU/Linux in electronic music courses at &lt;br /&gt;
Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. In 2000,     &lt;br /&gt;
excited by the ideals of Free Software, he tried to switch his desktop from  &lt;br /&gt;
Windows to Debian but with limited knowledge of networking and basic admin   &lt;br /&gt;
tasks, was unable to get a basic system up and running. Soon after moving to &lt;br /&gt;
Los Angeles in 2002, he joined a Linux Users Group and found the support he  &lt;br /&gt;
needed to do all his personal and business computer tasks with free software.  &lt;/p&gt;

This 
latest incarnation uses the hybrid-hosted model developed by Fonality for    &lt;br /&gt;
PBXtra, but gives installers the control over the hardware and phone         &lt;br /&gt;
provisioning that they enjoy with trixbox CE.                                  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerry Garrison has been in the IT industry for over 20 years with positions  &lt;br /&gt;
ranging from IT Director of a large multi-site distribution company to       &lt;br /&gt;
developing a large hosted web server platform for a major ISP, to running his&lt;br /&gt;
own IT consulting business in Southern California. Kerry was introduced to the 
world of Asterisk by a friend and began installing Asterisk-based phone      &lt;br /&gt;
systems for his small business clients. He wrote articles about Asterisk and &lt;br /&gt;
trixbox that became extremely popular on the net, and eventually published the 
definitive book on trixbox, "trixbox Made Easy." Today, Kerry is the senior  &lt;br /&gt;
product development manager for trixbox at Fonality. Kerry regularly speaks at 
trade shows, user groups, and radio programs. He is also the publisher of both 
http://www.voipspeak.net and http://www.asterisktutorials.com [dead]. Kerry is an   &lt;br /&gt;
avid amateur photographer who writes tutorials and product reviews for his   &lt;br /&gt;

While they share the basic PKI          &lt;br /&gt;
infrastructure that PGP and others do, X509 (and SSL by extension) are more  &lt;br /&gt;
complicated. Extending beyond the basic encryption, signing, decryption, and &lt;br /&gt;
verification of basic PKI, X509 includes a variety of extra pieces and       &lt;br /&gt;
information enabling more features. This talk will cover what X509 and SSL   &lt;br /&gt;
are, how they relate, how to use them, and how to learn more. It will discuss&lt;br /&gt;
PKI from both an certificate end-user perspective as well as from a          &lt;br /&gt;
Certificate Authority perspective. If time permits, a small comparison to PGP&lt;br /&gt;
will also be included akin to the one at the end of my PGP talk.               &lt;/p&gt;

adoption                                                                       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our speaker is Steve Friedl, a software consultant in Orange County who's been 
using UNIX since the early '80s, using Windows since the late '80s, and has  &lt;br /&gt;
more than 20 years of cross-platform consulting and commercial software      &lt;br /&gt;
development experience. He has taught advanced C/UNIX at Bell Labs, and is the 
only Microsoft MVP with "unix" in his domain name (unixwiz.net).               &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He'll be making the case that Linux has some stumbling blocks that make      &lt;br /&gt;
enterprise management and deployment much more difficult than they need to be, 
and what road there might be to make some progress on these fronts.            &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of websites that will give you a weather report for your    &lt;br /&gt;
city, but what about your neighborhood? Ever wonder how hot your attic got   &lt;br /&gt;
during the summer or how well your air conditioner is working? Claude        &lt;br /&gt;
Felizardo will describe his 1-wire weather station and how it has grown from a 
simple kit with a single temperature sensor, wind speed, and direction to    &lt;br /&gt;
multiple sensors located throughout his house and publishes the measurements &lt;br /&gt;
to the Internet.                                                               &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claude has over 15 years experience developing software on Unix platforms and&lt;br /&gt;
has been playing with Linux since the late 90's. His friends and family think&lt;br /&gt;
he has too many gadgets, but he's always looking for something new to play   &lt;br /&gt;
with, especially if it works with Linux.                                       &lt;/p&gt;

MySQL Replication is the means by which one or more MySQL &lt;br /&gt;
databases can keep data synchronized with a master server. The scope of      &lt;br /&gt;
replicated data can cover any range, whether a single table, or              &lt;br /&gt;
indiscriminately all the databases on the master server. MySQL Replication is&lt;br /&gt;
beginning to find progressively more exposure in corporate production        &lt;br /&gt;
environments, where it sees use from providing hot backups, to distributing  &lt;br /&gt;
access load amongst large numbers of users. Solomon Chang will cover four main 
topics:                                                                      &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt; Requirements of MySQL Replication                                        &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; Concepts of MySQL Replication                                            &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt; Configuring MySQL Replication                                            &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; Troubleshooting MySQL Replication                                          &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soloman will provide a master to replicate from, so attendees are encouraged &lt;br /&gt;
to bring their own computers running MySQL (4.1 or later, please) to configure 
as a hands-on slave. Attendees will also have full access to Solomon's master. 
If there is time, more advanced topics will be discussed:                    &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt; Pyramid Architectures                                                    &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; Dual Masters                                                             &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt; Circular Replication                                                     &lt;br /&gt;

they'll talk about the interesting languages and technologies they use in    &lt;br /&gt;
their distribution. When asked what they will present in detail, Clifford    &lt;br /&gt;
responded, "The core OS group at Linspire recently announced that we are     &lt;br /&gt;
standardizing on Haskell as our primary development language, whenever       &lt;br /&gt;
appropriate. In reality, we have been using both O'Caml and Haskell for years. 
Projects include:                                                            &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt; hardware detection and configuration,                                    &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; creation of installation CDs,                                            &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt; package dependancy checker,                                              &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; translation utilities for IRMA, and                                      &lt;br /&gt;
* many internal CGI/Web applications.                                        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the whirlwind of diversity that characterizes the Open Source development&lt;br /&gt;
model, functional programming provides us an eye of tranquility. In          &lt;br /&gt;
particular, static typing has proven invaluable. We will discuss the benefits&lt;br /&gt;
of systems programming with functional languages using the management of a   &lt;br /&gt;
Linux distribution as an example."                                             &lt;/p&gt;

state of the job market in Los Angeles, with special emphasis on tech roles  &lt;br /&gt;
and open-source fields. There will also be a primer on how to prepare yourself 
to land the best job possible. Whether you are a linux guru or a newbie, this&lt;br /&gt;

However, many people &lt;br /&gt;
don't fully understand it-even people who use it. This talk mostly will cover&lt;br /&gt;
uses and effects of PGP. The discussion will focus on PGP and e-mail, and    &lt;br /&gt;
other topics will be covered as well. How cryptography works and the math    &lt;br /&gt;
behind it will not be covered.                                                 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keysigning party                                                               &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of PGP is the "web of trust" that grows out of       &lt;br /&gt;
individuals signing each other's keys as a way of validating that the        &lt;br /&gt;
keyholder is indeed the "owner" of the key. We encourge you to create a key  &lt;br /&gt;
(if you don't already have one), post it to a public keyserver, and bring your 
"fingerprint" to the meeting for a keysigning party.                           &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the presenter                                                            &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to a scheduling conflict, Chris was unable to present this last November,&lt;br /&gt;
so we've asked him to return this month.                                       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Smith of Yahoo! to present a slice of life-on-the-inside of the world's&lt;br /&gt;
largest content provider.                                                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris will demonstrate some of the cutting edge work being conducted at Yahoo! 
Research Labs, all of which is powered by UNIX and open source computing.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of Yahoo!'s Research Technology team, Chris has more than 10 years of 
experience developing enterprise software solutions for both Internet        &lt;br /&gt;
start-ups and as a Senior Java Architect for Sun Microsystems.                 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you mention "running more than one operating system" on a computer, most&lt;br /&gt;
people will think "dual boot", and for a wide variety of tasks that is quite &lt;br /&gt;
appropriate. But how many of you have thought of running more than one system&lt;br /&gt;
at the same time? Sure, you're only "one person," so why should the computer &lt;br /&gt;
act like you were two people doing different things?                           &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you might not want to reboot your machine -- especially if you have a  &lt;br /&gt;
long-running task going on such as "seti at home" (since rebooting will cause&lt;br /&gt;
the "work unit" to be lost.) You might be a developer, and you're working on &lt;br /&gt;
something intended to be "cross platform" -- if every "rebuild-and-test" cycle 
included "reboot the machine", you'd tire of it rather quickly. Or perhaps you 
have two programs, each of which runs under a different OS, but you need to  &lt;br /&gt;
refer to the output of one program while working on the other.                 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this describes you and you haven't heard of VMware, then you need to attend 
the February SGVLUG meeting. This month we'll have Phil Anthony, a Sr. Systems 
Engineer from VMware, here to talk about what VMware has to offer -- he plans&lt;br /&gt;
to talk about the entier line -- from the ESX server to the workstation to   &lt;br /&gt;
their newest offering, the "free" VMware player. (this is "free as in beer", &lt;br /&gt;
folks...)                                                                      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Finley of Transformix will be here to show off the Eclipse IDE by IBM. 
By popular vote, the presentation will be targeting the beginner, but there  &lt;br /&gt;
will be plenty of opportunity to dig into deeper subjects.                     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Finley has extensive software development and consulting experience on the 
HP 3000, as well as on a variety of large-scale computers, minicomputers, and&lt;br /&gt;
personal computers. He has over 30 years of combined experience in the data  &lt;br /&gt;
processing industry and has held both technical and management positions. He &lt;br /&gt;
has conducted over 70 computer-related seminars throughout the U.S. and Canada 
and is a former faculty member of the Industrial Relations Center at the     &lt;br /&gt;
California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) in Pasadena. He studied        &lt;br /&gt;
management at UCLA, received a Certificate in Data Processing (CDP) from the &lt;br /&gt;
Data Processing Management Association, and holds a B.A. in business economics 
from the University of California, Santa Barbara.                              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CinePaint is an open source software application primarily used for motion   &lt;br /&gt;
picture frame-by-frame retouching and dust-busting. Many films, such as Harry&lt;br /&gt;
Potter and Spider-Man, use CinePaint. It was used by Flash Film Works to add &lt;br /&gt;
flying arrows in The Last Samurai, work that helped them win a VES award for &lt;br /&gt;
Best Supporting Effects. CinePaint is the most popular open source application 
in motion picture production.                                                  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CinePaint project leader Robin Rowe will talk about the new Glasgow          &lt;br /&gt;
architecture, what's implemented, and what remains to be done. CinePaint     &lt;br /&gt;
Glasgow is scheduled for release on December 31, 2005. Glasgow runs on Linux,&lt;br /&gt;
Windows, and Mac OSX. Robin Rowe has led CinePaint since 2002. He's the      &lt;br /&gt;
founder of LinuxMovies.org. He's a partner in motion picture technology      &lt;br /&gt;
company MovieEditor.com.                                                       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt will discuss OpenSolaris's goals, how licensing works (and why you      &lt;br /&gt;
shouldn't be afraid of it) and how to get involved. This meeting will also   &lt;br /&gt;
cover what OpenSolaris is (and isn't) and have a brief demo. Take a look at  &lt;br /&gt;

His first Linux was Slackware, in 1996. Since then he's moved to Red Hat Linux 
and then Fedora Core. While not a programmer, he's actively involved in the  &lt;br /&gt;

Most of the blockbuster films in theaters today were produced using Linux. How 
did this happen? Why are all the large studios using Linux as their preferred&lt;br /&gt;
platform for creating feature animation and visual effects?"                   &lt;/p&gt;

systems engineering, says: "For the past couple of months, I've been working
with Plone. It's an impressive system, and not exactly something you pick up
in a Saturday. Previously, I had never done any Web-related development; Plone
is a Zope tool that allows you to juggle Web portals like bowling
pins...provided you know how to take advantage of it. Quite powerful."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About Zope and Plone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Zope is an open source application server for building content management
systems, intranets, portals, and custom applications....Zope is written in
Python, a highly-productive, object-oriented scripting language."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, see http://www.zope.org/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Plone is an out-of-the-box ready content management system that is built on
the powerful and free Zope Application server. It requires minimal effort to
set up, is deeply flexible, and provides you with a system for managing web
content that is ideal for project groups, communities and intranets."&lt;/p&gt;
