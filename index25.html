<p>CinePaint is an open source software application primarily used for motion   <br />
picture frame-by-frame retouching and dust-busting. Many films, such as Harry<br />
Potter and Spider-Man, use CinePaint. It was used by Flash Film Works to add <br />
flying arrows in The Last Samurai, work that helped them win a VES award for <br />
Best Supporting Effects. CinePaint is the most popular open source application 
in motion picture production.                                                  </p>
<p>CinePaint project leader Robin Rowe will talk about the new Glasgow          <br />
architecture, what's implemented, and what remains to be done. CinePaint     <br />
Glasgow is scheduled for release on December 31, 2005. Glasgow runs on Linux,<br />
Windows, and Mac OSX. Robin Rowe has led CinePaint since 2002. He's the      <br />
founder of LinuxMovies.org. He's a partner in motion picture technology      <br />
company MovieEditor.com.                                                       </p>

various open source communities and talk a bit about the latest, greatest hunk 
of intellectual property Sun's released to the wild: OpenSolaris.              </p>
<p>Matt will discuss OpenSolaris's goals, how licensing works (and why you      <br />
shouldn't be afraid of it) and how to get involved. This meeting will also   <br />
cover what OpenSolaris is (and isn't) and have a brief demo. Take a look at  <br />
http://www.opensolaris.org/os/about/ before attending to develop your own    <br />
questions about the project.                                                   </p>
<p>Matt is a Technical Specialist for Sun Microsystems and supports a variety of<br />
customers across the Western US. Based in Los Angeles, Matt has worked with a<br />
number of customers on Linux and Solaris adoption and migration from other   <br />
platforms. Matt is part of the Web Services practice of the Client Solutions <br />
organization which specializes in use of Java Enterprise System software use <br />

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Orv Beach has been messing with computers for over 20 years. His first       <br />
experience with computer operating systems was with CP/M, in the early '80s. <br />
His first Linux was Slackware, in 1996. Since then he's moved to Red Hat Linux 
and then Fedora Core. While not a programmer, he's actively involved in the  <br />
Linux community.                                                               </p>
<p>He's a principal member of the Simi-Conejo Linux Users Group, the Marketing  <br />
chair for the Linux Expo of Southern California, and is currently employed as<br />
the Information System Director at Simi Valley Hospital.                       </p>
<p>Orv will demonstrate various command line commands and utilities that are    <br />
useful for administering a Linux system. He'll throw in a few basic bash     <br />
tricks as a bonus.                                                             </p>
