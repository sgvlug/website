X509 and SSL are complicated topics. While they share the basic PKI            
infrastructure that PGP and others do, X509 (and SSL by extension) are more    
complicated. Extending beyond the basic encryption, signing, decryption, and   
verification of basic PKI, X509 includes a variety of extra pieces and         
information enabling more features. This talk will cover what X509 and SSL     
are, how they relate, how to use them, and how to learn more. It will discuss  
PKI from both an certificate end-user perspective as well as from a            
Certificate Authority perspective. If time permits, a small comparison to PGP  
will also be included akin to the one at the end of my PGP talk.
