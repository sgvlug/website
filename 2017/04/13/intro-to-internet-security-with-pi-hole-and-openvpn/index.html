    <p><strong>This month, we are hosted by <a href="http://www.everbridge.com/">Everbridge</a> at
their training center.  Everbridge is also sponsoring food and drink.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>Protecting your digital identity, passwords, and browsing activity is
difficult in the world of open Wifi networks, freeware, and advanced
advertising techniques based on tracking users across the web. While complete
privacy is not possible while connected to the internet, there are many things
you can do to make access to your personal data more difficult. This
presentation will focus on the basics of internet security, how to begin
protecting your network and your data, and why it's so important. We will
focus on the two most prominent (and easiest to fix) security vulnerabilities:
encrypting your browsing on external networks using OpenVPN, and blocking
advertising and tracking as early as possible using Pi-Hole.  </p>
