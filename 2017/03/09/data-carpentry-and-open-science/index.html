    <p>We will be socializing until 7:30am and then we'll do our usual LUG
announcements and Linux in the News and talk about last weekend's Southern
California Linux Expo.  Presentations usually start at 8pm.</p>
<p><em>If we have at least 30 attendees, we will raffle off leftover booth swag.
Every attendee gets a free ticket and you will be able to buy additional
tickets at $1 apiece.  Funds raised go towards SGVTech expenses, which are
primarily Meetup fees and domain name and webhosting.</em></p>
<p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>The open science movement calls for open sharing of research findings and
greater trust, transparency, and reuseability in making claims and reporting
results. A researcher-to-researcher training community known as Carpentry
(Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and others) has emerged to prepare
researchers to practice open science using more open and collaborative
practices; open source tools; and openly licensed and distributed methods,
data, code.</p>
<p>In this program, the Head of Research Services at the Caltech Library will
describe the Carpentry movement; illustrate how lesson development and
delivery takes place; and lead participants through a sample interactive
lesson from Data Carpentry.</p>
<p>There will be an interactive lesson.  Please bring a fully charged laptop.<br />
Installation instructions and lesson outline will be posted ahead of time. 
OpenX has guest wifi.
<strong>We will comment in the Meetup, if there are any updates.</strong></p>
