Topic The open science movement calls for open sharing of research findings and greater trust, transparency, and reuseability in making claims and reporting results. A researcher-to-researcher training community known as Carpentry (Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and others) has emerged to prepare researchers to practice open science using more open and collaborative practices; open source tools; and openly licensed and distributed methods, data, code. In this program, the Head of Research Services at the Caltech Library will describe the Carpentry movement; illustrate how lesson development and delivery takes place; and lead participants through a sample interactive lesson from Data Carpentry. There will be an interactive lesson. Please bring a fully charged laptop. Installation instructions and lesson outline will be posted ahead of time. OpenX has guest wifi.
