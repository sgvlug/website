    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>One of the many strengths of Linux is that it runs on commodity hardware from
an extensive PC ecosystem. We have the freedom to assemble components in a way
that is customized for our own specific needs. And now we can easily continue
our customization to the physical form factor, thanks to recent advances
lowering the cost of fabrication technologies like 3D printing and laser
cutting. Not just the cosmetic art of the "case mod" audience, either:
motivated tinkerers can build functionally useful creations and share them
with the world.</p>
<p>We will walk through several custom computer projects, starting with the
"Luggable PC" seen at recent SGVLUG meetups. Each project has its own
motivation, design constraints, and undergo several iterations to refine the
idea. The latest version of each project will be available for hands-on
examination, some accompanied by their predecessors to show design evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Roger Cheng grew up in the San Gabriel Valley and studied Computer Science at
UCLA. Upon graduation he moved out of town for a 16 year career in (closed-
source) commercial software development. Seeking a change of pace, he quit and
moved back. Now he is having a great time exploring the world of open-source
and meeting local enthusiasts.</p>
