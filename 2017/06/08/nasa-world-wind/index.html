    <p><strong><em>This month, we are hosted by <a href="http://www.everbridge.com/">Everbridge</a> at their training center. Everbridge is also sponsoring food and drink. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>TOPIC:</strong></p>
<p>NASA World Wind is an open source virtual globe that makes it easy to build 3D
geospatial applications. World Wind provides APIs for Java, Android, and
JavaScript, and includes a powerful set of capabilities for visualizing and
interacting with spatial data and imagery. In the first part of this
presentation I will discuss some the main features of World Wind, as well as
the World Wind team's development philosophy. The second part of the evening
will be an interactive workshop, in which we will build a simple geo
application using the Web World Wind JavaScript API.</p>
<p><strong>BIO:</strong></p>
<p>Parker Abercrombie is a senior software engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, and is the project lead for OnSight, a mixed reality tool that
allows scientists and engineers to work virtually on Mars. Parker is also the
lead developer of the science targeting software for the upcoming Mars 2020
rover mission. Prior to joining JPL, Parker worked on geovisualization
software for NASA's Ames Research Center and the U.S. Department of Energy,
including World Wind, winner of the NASA Software of the Year Award in 2009.
Parker holds an M.A. in Geography from Boston University, and a B.S. in
Creative Studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara (which he
swears is more technical than it sounds).</p>
