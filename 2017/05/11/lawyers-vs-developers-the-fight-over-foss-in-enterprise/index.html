    <p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>Enterprises have learned that Open Source is the way to develop great and mature 
software. Leveraging open source tools and packages allows the enterprise to go to 
market faster and have stronger applications. Therefore, using Open Source tools 
is a no brainer for developers. The lawyers on the other hand don’t see it the same way.</p>
<p>The speaker had the privilege of working with the Open Source approval and review 
process in a large security firm. In this talk, he will share lessons learned from 
this process and some best practices that developers should do to make the Enterprise 
Lawyers happy as much as the developers are.</p>
<p>Each organization that uses Open Source software – even in an unedited form – has a list 
of FOSS licenses that are acceptable and some that are not. Also, has strict requirements 
on how to handle the software and how to incorporate it in the distribution of the 
company’s products. In this talk, we go through some of the lessons learned and pitfalls 
that some Open Source packages have, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not inserting a copyright clause in project code or homepage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asking the user to alter the code in order to change the license from GPL to MIT, for example</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using dependencies that could be outdated or have CVE’s against it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not providing enough information to build the code from scratch</p>
</li>
</ul>
