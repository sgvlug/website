    <p>Monthly Meeting.                                                               </p>
<h2>Topic: Virtualmin / Webmin + Brief review Defcon/Blackhat:</h2>
<p>Take your Drupal sites to the next level with the free, open-source Webmin   <br />
control panel and its powerful Virtualmin plug-in. Add as many features as you 
want, including unlimited domains, mail accounts, Subversion repositories,   <br />
mailing lists, and more with a point-and-click web interface.                  </p>
<p>Webmin and Virtualmin are similar to cPanel and WHM, respectively, and can   <br />
manage dozens or even hundreds of domains. They are the perfect tools for    <br />
creating test and development sites, hosting client websites or even managing<br />
a full-blown online infrastructure for running a business.                     </p>
<p>Did we forget to mention, Webmin and Virtualmin are free* and open-source?   <br />
Compared to site licensing costs of cPanel, WHM, Plesk and other proprietary <br />
control panels, Webmin and Virtualmin cost only as much as a basic           <br />
$10-20/month VPS account.                                                      </p>

sysadmin for LA Drupal and the DrupalCamp LA website (which uses Virtualmin) <br />
