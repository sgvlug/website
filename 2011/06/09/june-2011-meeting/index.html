    <p>The Caltech team participating in the U.S. Department of Energy 2011 Solar   <br />
Decathlon will present their project, for which they are using various       <br />
open-source technology.                                                        </p>
<p>"The Solar Decathlon is a U.S. Department of Energy Sponsored competition    <br />
which challenges teams of college and graduate students from around the world<br />
to design and build solar-powered, net-zero houses. Inside the SCI-Arc/Caltech 
entry, code named CHIP, a sophisticated home automation system monitors every<br />
watt of electricity consumed and visually communicates the information to    <br />
homeowners. It also plays a central role in optimizing the behavior of the   <br />
house at all times, such as by controlling operation of the active thermal   <br />
mass, shutting down appliances or lights that are no longer used, and of     <br />
course giving the homeowners an instant understanding into how their own     <br />
behaviors affects their energy use and in turn their energy bill."             </p>
