<p>Docker is a hot trend in today's tech community, making it easier than ever to
containerize and deploy modern, and legacy software applications.  While often
mistaken for virtualization, containers take a new, lightweight approach to
abstracting and isolating the runtime environment, dependencies and networking
required by modern software.</p>
<p>This talk will cover how to get started with Docker, best practices for
containers and example workflows for developing and deploying containers
locally and in cloud environments. After this talk you should have the
essential building blocks for building a containerized environment and
application stack.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>The wonderful folks at OpenX are hosting this meeting and providing pizza and
drinks.  <strong>Consequently, we require RSVPs 48 hours in advance.  RSVPs are
currently capped at 35.  We may open it up if there is demand.  Please keep
RSVPs up-to-date.</strong></p>
<p>We will socialize and eat around 6pm, and the talk will start at 7pm.  Big
thanks to Bobby at OpenX for making the arrangements. </p>
<p><strong>TOPIC</strong></p>
<p>Andrew Hamilton will go over the basics of Ansible and discuss why it's a
great tool for running simple commands, complex tasks and workflows across a
group of systems.</p>
<p>Ansible is a powerful but simple automation tool. Ansible is simple enough
that most developers and administrators will be able to understand the scripts
without much trouble. With this simplicity, Ansible is great for organizations
looking for a tool that both dev and ops can use together. The YAML based
syntax of Ansible is also much easier to understand than the DSL that some
other tools use.</p>
<p><strong>BIO</strong></p>
<p>Andrew is currently a Systems Architect at Prevoty where he focuses on
automation and infrastructure. Previously he was an SRE for Search @Twitter
and a system administrator for Eucalyptus. Andrew is passionate about cloud
computing and automation.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>OpenX is located in the One West Bank building @ 888 E Walnut St.  Pasadena CA, 91101. Entrances to the building are eastbound on Walnut, right hand side before the Lake St. intersection or southbound on Lake St. right hand side after the Walnut St. intersection. Once through the driveway, please park in the 888 Lot that has the OpenX logo displayed out front. Pull a ticket and bring it with you to the Meet-Up, we will validate your parking.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MORE ON ANSIBLE:</strong></p>
<p>Ansible has many features common to configuration management systems such as
Puppet and Chef. Ansible uses a simple execution model compared to Puppet and
Chef that is much easier for new users to understand. The majority of the
modules it provides are indepotent so a playbook can be run multiple times
without causing problems by running a change multiple times if it isn't
needed. The use of YAML to describe your playbooks also makes creating and
editing Ansible playbooks much easier.</p>
<p>Interacting directly with services such as AWS, GCE, Azure or OpenStack is
easy through a set of provided modules. Ansible allows you to create an entire
deployment framework with one tool that can provision hosts, configure and
install software, add and remove servers from a load balancer and finally
terminate the old instances. Ansible can also use dynamically generated lists
of hosts making it easy to work in highly dynamic environments.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful features of Ansible is that hosts are accessed over
SSH. There is no need to install additional daemons or to open up additional
ports. You can simply write a playbook, give it a set of hosts to run against,
provide a set of credentials and watch Ansible do what you've told it to do.</p>
<p>You also don't need to give Ansible access to root unless it is required for
the playbook. Ansible can use either sudo or su to escalate privileges for
single tasks or entire playbooks.</p>
<p>Ansible core is written in Python so it's easy to run and extend. If Python is
your language of choice, Ansible provides you with a set of modules that make
writing your own modules easy. If you're not a Python developer, Ansible
allows modules to be written in any language that can accept JSON through
STDIN and then return JSON back to through STDOUT. Ansible can also be used as
a library in Python that allows you to easily take advantage of some of its
features in custom scripts. Ansible is a flexible tool that allows users to
easily perform both adhoc remote command execution and configuration
management across a group of hosts. Getting started with Ansible is easy and
has relatively low overhead. Ansible playbooks are simple enough that they can
be compared with shell scripts. We'll go over the basics of Ansible and
discuss why it's a great tool for running simple commands, complex tasks and
workflows across a group of systems.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Streaming-OODT was originally conceived to overcome the limitations of
traditional big-data processing and management systems. It is based on an open
source data processing framework called OODT (Object Oriented Data Technology)
and was funded by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Big Data Research &amp;
Technology Development initiative "Archiving, Processing and Dissemination for
the Big Data Era". The vision behind the project is to combine state-of-the-
art technologies into an easy-to-use big-data processing system prepackaged to
allow users to quickly process big-data without the need to patch together
individual technologies.</p>
<p>Streaming-OODT provides both traditional batch processing as well as in-memory
MapReduce processing for use on general computing clusters. Cluster management
and multi-tenancy is provided via Apache Mesos, which manages batch processing
as well as the Streaming-OODT's underlying technologies. This ensures that
multi-tenancy is applied to both the system and the user's processing.</p>
<p>Apache Spark provides in-memory MapReduce processing enabling processing at
speeds hundreds of times faster than Hadoop MapReduce. This system is
augmented by Apache Kafka used to manage streaming data. This enables the user
to process streaming data alongside traditional data in Apache Spark and thus
tackle data-sets too large to persist en-masse to disk, while not losing the
ability to process data sets that already exist on disk.</p>
<p>Tachyon, an in-memory distributed file system, provides lightning-fast
distributed access to data files and streams on all nodes of the cluster.
Persistence is provided by Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) thus allowing
the user both fast data access and persistence to disk.</p>
<p>The purpose of this talk is to demonstrate Streaming-OODT, which will enable
the audience to use Streaming-OODT and supporting technologies to quickly
tackle their own big-data problems. The talk will introduce Streaming-OODT,
show how to quickly install and configure the system, explain the value added
by the underlying technologies, and walk through a working example of big-data
processing. Finally, benchmarks will be presented so that the audience can see
the benefit of these technologies and their combination.</p>
