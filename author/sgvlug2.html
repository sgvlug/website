<p><strong>Practical AWK - AWKwardly Dealing with Data</strong></p>
<p>AWK is a text processing programming language developed at Bell Labs in the
1970s. It was originally used for data extraction and reporting. It inspired
the creation of Perl and can, for the most part, be replaced by Python. It is
still incredibly useful on the Linux command-line, both for one-liners or for
short, powerful scripts.</p>
<p>Most people have used AWK in one way or another, but they use it without
understanding the language. AWK syntax can seem strange. But once you
understand that it is a data-driven pattern action language where the data is
automatically parsed into predefined variables, it becomes a powerful and
intuitive tool.</p>
<p>This talk seeks to take the mystery out of AWK by giving a quick introduction
to the language and its features. There will be examples where it provides
functionality that a dedicated utility like grep or cut or head might not.
There will also be more complex examples where a few lines of AWK result in
useful summarization of large amounts of raw data.</p>
<p>AWK is a great Swiss Army knife if you spend a lot of time on the command-
line.</p>

<p>The Unix Operating System has been around since the 1960s and has provided the
backbone for the modern "Internet."</p>
<p>The core of the Unix and Linux experience is the command line shell. This
powerful text based interface can be leveraged to automate tasks and solve
problems that would be too tedious to tackle.  The Born Again Shell is
available on all Unix and Linux platforms.  A clear understanding of the
features of the shell along with a basic set of commands can improve your
productivity and change the way you implement solutions to text based
problems.</p>
<p>Eric will provide an overview of how his Unix/Linux classroom has evolved over
26 years.  From the blackboard handwritten lecture in a room without computers
to modern classroom with a computer on every desk.  Through it all, the common
set of command line capabilities has remained a staple in the Unix/Linux
mindset.  sed, grep, cut, tr, and awk are tools that can be combined to
transform the simplest of users into a "Power User".</p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Eric Danielson was first exposed to FORTRAN as part of a Saturday high school
program at JPL.  Before that, he hadn't been exposed to computers except for
watching his father open up a briefcase sized modem to transfer files using
the house phone handset.  The Saturday class would walk onto the JPL campus
and sit at someone's desk to log into a VAX terminal to edit, compile and run
FORTRAN77 code.</p>
<p>Eric has since earned a B.S. in General Engineering from Harvey Mudd College
and a M.S. in Computer Science from USC.  Eric started working at JPL as a
summer student.  At that time, he was running radiative transfer code
(FORTRAN) and supporting a science team.  After the brand new Sun Microsystem
workstations were installed in the Science Division computer lab, Eric took
some evening classes at Glendale College that included C Programing and Unix
Shell Programming.  Soon after, a co-worker and mentor at JPL encouraged Eric
to take over his teaching workload at Glendale College.  An increase in his
JPL travel schedule was making it difficult to continue teaching. Eric started
teaching BASIC Programming and FORTRAN in 1989.  He eventually took over the
Unix class and has since added the Unix/Linux System Administration class to
the Glendale College curriculum.</p>
<p>Eric is currently the Science Data System (SDS) System Engineer for the Multi-
angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on the Terra Earth Observing
System satellite and the Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) instrument
currently in development.</p>
<p>Eric enjoys tinkering with Raspberry Pis and Arduinos in the creative realm of
"Makers".  His recent projects include a portable air quality monitor and a
time-lapse camera with a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>In this talk <a href="http://christinecorbettmoran.com/">Dr. Corbett Moran</a> will discuss the challenges 
and rewards of instructing a mixed skill class in an apprenticeship style learning environment.</p>
<p>On June 26-August 4, 2017 she led a summer program, <a href="http://summerappspace.com/">Summer App Space</a>, 
for LA students and teachers to learn programming while getting paid to do fun space-related projects. Her work on
this was supported by NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
award AST-1501208. Summer App Space is a paid apprenticeship where high school
students are paid to attend a six week school learning to program in Python
and the fundamentals of Linux, 20 hours per week. Four weeks are lecture and
lab based, and the last two weeks are project based incorporating a deliverable product and entrepreneurial style teams. </p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Corbett Moran is the lead curriculum designer, recruiter and instructor
for the Summer App Space (SAS) 2017 program. She brings to the table extensive
experience in running such programs from a teaching, technology,
organizational, scientific and industry connection perspective.</p>
<p>She taught introductory and advanced courses in MIT MEET: Middle East
Education Through Technology for two summers. MEET is a gifted high school
program in which she taught Java programming and mobile app development in a
project, lecture, and guest speaker format. MEET's mission is creating a
common professional language between Israeli and Palestinian young leaders.
Dr. Corbett Moran served as the lead technical instructor in MIT's Global
Startup labs in the Philippines for a summer to students from a variety of
backgrounds and socio-economic status in the Manila area in a highly similar
format to that planned for SAS. She has organized speakers and technology for
TEDxZurich as well as hackathons for Open WhisperSystems and a site of the
NASA Space Apps Challenge, on which she is basing SAS projects.</p>
<p>Dr. Corbett Moran dually majored in Physics and Computer Science at MIT,
obtained a Master's and Ph.D. focusing on Computational Astrophysics at UZH,
and her NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship research is at
the intersection of the two. She has worked for SpaceX as an intern in
Propulsion Analysis and has over 10 years of industry programming experience
in cutting-edge web and mobile technologies. Dr. Corbett Moran has served as a
teaching assistant and lab assistant for 8 courses, spoken around the globe as
a highly praised public speaker, and mentored several students. Dr. Corbett
Moran's participation has been enabled by NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics
Postdoctoral Fellowship award AST-1501208.</p>

why Rust helps you think about other programming languages more accurately,
why Rust helps you communicate with your team, and how you can help test some

<p>What if I told you that most or all nontrivial C and C++ programs you have ever
written were just illusions? Most such programs contain undefined behavior, and
undefined behavior is at the heart of most C and C++ security problems, yet few
programmers understand how far down that rabbit hole goes. We will swallow the
red pill and study the nature and extent of undefined behavior in C and C++,
techniques for writing more secure, reliable C and C++ in spite of the reality
of undefined behavior and other mischief, and little-used compiler flags and
other tools to detect and/or eliminate bugs.</p>

<p>One of the many strengths of Linux is that it runs on commodity hardware from
an extensive PC ecosystem. We have the freedom to assemble components in a way
that is customized for our own specific needs. And now we can easily continue
our customization to the physical form factor, thanks to recent advances
lowering the cost of fabrication technologies like 3D printing and laser
cutting. Not just the cosmetic art of the "case mod" audience, either:
motivated tinkerers can build functionally useful creations and share them
with the world.</p>
<p>We will walk through several custom computer projects, starting with the
"Luggable PC" seen at recent SGVLUG meetups. Each project has its own
motivation, design constraints, and undergo several iterations to refine the
idea. The latest version of each project will be available for hands-on
examination, some accompanied by their predecessors to show design evolution.</p>
