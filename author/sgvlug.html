<p>What if I told you that most or all nontrivial C and C++ programs you have ever
written were just illusions? Most such programs contain undefined behavior, and
undefined behavior is at the heart of most C and C++ security problems, yet few
programmers understand how far down that rabbit hole goes. We will swallow the
red pill and study the nature and extent of undefined behavior in C and C++,
techniques for writing more secure, reliable C and C++ in spite of the reality
of undefined behavior and other mischief, and little-used compiler flags and
other tools to detect and/or eliminate bugs.</p>

<p>Intending to become a programmer ("developer" hadn't been invented by
the marketing department yet), Dustin got sidetracked and spent more
time than he cares to admit doing theoretical physics, a background
filled with continuous mathematics almost entirely irrelevant to
computer science. He eventually returned to his original love of, and
though they probably won't admit it currently hacks code for Whitemoon
Dreams, Inc.  He avoids social media for the same reason he doesn't do
crack cocaine.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>One of the many strengths of Linux is that it runs on commodity hardware from
an extensive PC ecosystem. We have the freedom to assemble components in a way
that is customized for our own specific needs. And now we can easily continue
our customization to the physical form factor, thanks to recent advances
lowering the cost of fabrication technologies like 3D printing and laser
cutting. Not just the cosmetic art of the "case mod" audience, either:
motivated tinkerers can build functionally useful creations and share them
with the world.</p>
<p>We will walk through several custom computer projects, starting with the
"Luggable PC" seen at recent SGVLUG meetups. Each project has its own
motivation, design constraints, and undergo several iterations to refine the
idea. The latest version of each project will be available for hands-on
examination, some accompanied by their predecessors to show design evolution.</p>

<p>Roger Cheng grew up in the San Gabriel Valley and studied Computer Science at
UCLA. Upon graduation he moved out of town for a 16 year career in (closed-
source) commercial software development. Seeking a change of pace, he quit and
moved back. Now he is having a great time exploring the world of open-source
and meeting local enthusiasts.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi has become a favorite of Amateur Radio operators world-wide.
Although most of the development on projects is occurring outside of the
United States, there are a significant number of products and hacks available.
Repeater controllers, VOIP servers, and even turning your Pi into a
transceiver is possible and is being done.</p>

<p>NASA World Wind is an open source virtual globe that makes it easy to build 3D
geospatial applications. World Wind provides APIs for Java, Android, and
JavaScript, and includes a powerful set of capabilities for visualizing and
interacting with spatial data and imagery. In the first part of this
presentation I will discuss some the main features of World Wind, as well as
the World Wind team's development philosophy. The second part of the evening
will be an interactive workshop, in which we will build a simple geo
application using the Web World Wind JavaScript API.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>Enterprises have learned that Open Source is the way to develop great and mature 
software. Leveraging open source tools and packages allows the enterprise to go to 
market faster and have stronger applications. Therefore, using Open Source tools 
is a no brainer for developers. The lawyers on the other hand don’t see it the same way.</p>
<p>The speaker had the privilege of working with the Open Source approval and review 
process in a large security firm. In this talk, he will share lessons learned from 
this process and some best practices that developers should do to make the Enterprise 
Lawyers happy as much as the developers are.</p>
<p>Each organization that uses Open Source software – even in an unedited form – has a list 
of FOSS licenses that are acceptable and some that are not. Also, has strict requirements 
on how to handle the software and how to incorporate it in the distribution of the 
company’s products. In this talk, we go through some of the lessons learned and pitfalls 
that some Open Source packages have, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not inserting a copyright clause in project code or homepage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asking the user to alter the code in order to change the license from GPL to MIT, for example</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using dependencies that could be outdated or have CVE’s against it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not providing enough information to build the code from scratch</p>
</li>
</ul>
