We will be socializing until 7:30am and then we'll do our usual LUG
announcements and Linux in the News and talk about last weekend's Southern
California Linux Expo.  Presentations usually start at 8pm.

  
*If we have at least 30 attendees, we will raffle off leftover booth swag.
Every attendee gets a free ticket and you will be able to buy additional
tickets at $1 apiece.  Funds raised go towards SGVTech expenses, which are
primarily Meetup fees and domain name and webhosting.*

  

  
**Topic**

The open science movement calls for open sharing of research findings and
greater trust, transparency, and reuseability in making claims and reporting
results. A researcher-to-researcher training community known as Carpentry
(Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and others) has emerged to prepare
researchers to practice open science using more open and collaborative
practices; open source tools; and openly licensed and distributed methods,
data, code.

In this program, the Head of Research Services at the Caltech Library will
describe the Carpentry movement; illustrate how lesson development and
delivery takes place; and lead participants through a sample interactive
lesson from Data Carpentry.

  
There will be an interactive lesson.  Please bring a fully charged laptop.  
Installation instructions and lesson outline will be posted ahead of time. 
OpenX has guest wifi.
**We will comment in the Meetup, if there are any updates.**
