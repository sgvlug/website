**This month, we are hosted by **[New Matter](http://newmatter.com)**, a new
3D printing company incubated at Idealab**.**  Please [RSVP on Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/SGVTech/events/234113164/) or email 
Lan (L dot Dang at ymail dot com). We'll head out to Du-Par's Restaurant
and Bakery (214 S Lake Ave, Pasadena) around 9:15pm for a late dinner.**


**Abstract:**

  
Dave Flynn will share his extensive experience with 3D printing from the past
4 years, as well as his motivations for designing and building his own 3D
printer.  Specifically, his experience is with the RepRap style of 3D
printers.

  
The presentation will be short as Dave much prefers answering questions.

  
We welcome the 3D printing community--whether they are experts or neophytes--
to share the things they've printed and spark a conversation about what we can
do with 3D printing, how to get started, and how 3D printing can be used for
art, home, hobby, and work.

  
Please contact Lan if you are bringing something for show and tell or want to do a lightning talk.
