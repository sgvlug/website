**The wonderful folks at OpenX are hosting this meeting and providing pizza and
drinks. We need to provide a list of names to building security.  We
require RSVPs by 5pm on Tuesday, March 8th.  Please keep RSVPs up-to-date,
particularly if we have a waitlist.  RSVPs will be capped at 70.

**Topic**

OnSight is a tool that allows scientists to work on Mars through the power of
virtual reality. The Mars terrain displayed in OnSight is produced from real
images sent back by the Curiosity rover, and rendered at 1:1 scale, as if the
user were actually standing on Mars. Behind this exciting user experience is a
powerful backend infrastructure that continually produces 3D terrain
reconstructions as new images are sent back by the Curiosity rover.

The terrain build system automatically detects when new images are available,
dynamically starts and stops computing instances to handle the workload, and
presents dashboards to view the progress of terrain builds. The system runs on
Amazon's cloud services platform, using a mix of Linux and Windows virtual
computing instances. The system leverages a variety of open source projects
including NodeJS, LoopBack, Ansible, Jenkins, AngularJS, and BootStrap. In
this talk will focus on the cloud computing aspects of the terrain system,
rather than on image processing. I will present a detailed look at the parts
of this system, and discuss the team's experience adapting a desktop data
processing workflow to a cloud architecture. Please join me for an applied
look at how data processing challenges can be addressed in a cloud computing
environment.

**Bio**

Parker Abercrombie is a software engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
where he builds software to support Mars science missions. He has a special
interest in geographic information systems, and has worked with teams at NASA
and the U.S. Department of Energy on systems for geographic visualization and
data management. Parker holds an M.A. in Geography from Boston University, and
a B.S. in Creative Studies with emphasis in Computer Science (which he swears
is more technical than it sounds) from the University of California, Santa
Barbara. In his spare time, Parker enjoys baking bread and playing the Irish
wooden flute.
