**The wonderful folks at OpenX are hosting this meeting, and they are also providing food.  We need to provide a list 
of names to building security. RSVPs will be capped at 40.  Contact Lan if you have questions.  See end of description for OpenX map  
**

**Note: Our original speaker, Christian Weber, had to cancel, but he sent us another speaker, Jennie Ohyoung, who is also a Solutions Engineer at GitHub.  The topic has changed slightly.
**

**Final Note: Our actual speaker was Michelle Unger who was gracious enough to fill in at the last minute.  Jennie Ohyoung was unable to make it due to flight cancellation.  Much thanks to Jamie Wetzel for coordinating on GitHub side.**

**Topic**

We will be covering the new features that were announced at GitHub Universe as well as how GitHub and other organizations use the GitHub's webhooks and API to enhance their existing workflows within GitHub.
