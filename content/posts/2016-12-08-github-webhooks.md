**Topic**

GitHub's webhooks are both powerful and flexible. Today we'll discuss using
webhooks in some common, and not so common ways, from Pull Request driven
infrastructure, to ChatOps driven CI, GitHub's webhooks provides you a myriad
of ways to monitor and guide your Development Environments. We'll also discuss
our robust API, and some data visualization techniques yielding from that
data.
