We are going virtual this month on Google Hangouts Meet. We'll see how things go with this format. If you're new to this platform:

Please be patient, as Lan will have to approve each connection.
Please turn on video during introductions. Mute unless you're speaking.

This month's topic is informal.

Lan Dang will do a brief intro to shells and shell scripting before going through both easy and advanced uses of bash constructs to get work done. If you don't know anything, this will help you get started. If you know a little shell scripting, you might pick up some advanced techniques. This is also a good opportunity to ask questions. Lan spends most of her time on the Linux command line using advanced features of bash, awk, and sed.

Agenda:

6:45 - Introductions, chat

7:05 - Announcements, discussion about future LUG meetings.

7:15 - Talk starts
