OpenSCAD is a free software program for 3D CAD modelling. Instead of an
interactive environment it uses a descriptive description language to build
objects. Dave Flynn will explain this and more:

1. What is Open SCAD?

2. What type of project is Open SCAD and 3D printing good for?

3. Organizing the part so it will be printable.

4. What is manifold anyway?

5. Building a complex part from simple objects.

6. In a demo of the process I will recreate a wheel from my Tank project.
