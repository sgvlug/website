There is no formal presentation this month.  We will go for adhoc talks and
discussions including:

* SGVLUG/SGVHAK year in review  + how you can contribute to keep the group going
* Southern California Linux Expo roundtable.  What is the discount code?  Who will be speaking at SCALE?  What are the plans for our booth?  What is the SCALE A/V team working on?
* Jess will give an overview on the current state of Linux Desktop Environments for those curious about what else is available out there
