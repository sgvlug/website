This month, SGVLUG and InfoSec Syndicate member Ray S will give a brief
history on P2P software technology, applications and implementations.

**Abstract**:

The P2P and the World of Tomorrow presentation will address a brief history on
the development on P2P software technology, applications and implementations
by the end user. Applications such as Audio Galaxy, Napster, Direct Connect,
Gnutella, Freenet, eDonkey2000, Kazaa, Morpheus, BitTorrent and Soulseek will
be discussed in the presentation. End user usage patterns based on net
cultural behavioral norms will be addressed as well as the development of
conflict as result of practicing such norms on a end user case-by-case basis.
Media attention and changes in policies of governance in relation to P2P
technology and usage are topics that will be touched on in the presentation.
New changes in P2P technology being made to maneuver difficulties that have
arisen from changes in governance policies are addressed later in the
presentation. The presentation's conclusion addresses technological
responsibility and safety practices the audience can use to prevent themselves
from becoming a marginalized end user as in the cases discussed earlier in the
presentation.
