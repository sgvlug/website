The old saying goes that "everyone has a book inside of them", and advances in
technology have made publishing more accessible than ever. The opportunities
in traditional and independent publishing are wide open.  But writing a book
remains a daunting task, and new authors will encounter many steps along the
way.

What does it take to publish information in the digital age?  Hybrid author
Nathan Haines discusses working with traditional publishers that use
proprietary software and formats, and describes the self-publishing process
from start to finish.  From ebooks to print, is Free and Open Source Software
up to the task?
