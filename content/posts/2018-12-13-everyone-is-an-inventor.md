Bin Feng, the co-founder and CEO of Microduino, will talk about lowering the
barrier of entry and inspiring creativity for STEAM education.

"I was monitoring a server room's temperature, but getting tired of going to
the room every, single, time. I used Arduino to create a device that would do
the job for me. However, it involved messy wiring, dangerous soldering, and
complicated coding. And so an idea was born. I wanted to create something that
anyone could use to imagine a product and immediately just build it. The very
first set of Microduino modules was designed to lower the barriers to
creativity for everyone. We're giving people the freedom to give shape to
their ideas."

The company creates the world's smallest Arduino-compatible smart modules.
These modules are flexible, stackable and powerful, and can be used to create
a limitless amount of DIY projects for all ages.

To date, Bin has raised over $500,000 across four Microduino crowdfunding
projects and built up Microduino's community from 0 to 1,000,000+ members and
students. Bin is dedicated to making Microduino a significant international
success by creating an educational platform that fits seamlessly into the
global STEM/STEAM education discipline.
