**Topic**

Liz Krane started the Learn to Code LA meetup group in 2015, and with
perseverance and some luck, the community grew to over 2200 members in less
than a year. In this talk, she will share what she learned by building a
community from scratch in a field she knew nothing about.

How do you build a community? From small open-source projects to international
movements, communities amplify our individual motivations and enable us to
create meaningful changes in the world. And on a personal level, communities
are essential for our well-being as social animals. What makes for a
successful community, and how do you persuade other people to get involved?

  
**Bio**

Liz Krane is the founder of Learn to Code LA, a community that introduces new
people to computer science and programming with classes and fun events.Liz is
a professional dabbler who dreams of learning something about everything.
Previously a research assistant at USC Annenberg, she currently works as a
freelance web developer, writer, photographer and designer, exploring the
intersections between technology, education and journalism.

  
**Plan**

At about 7:30pm, we'll start the meeting with LUG business and Linux in the
News.  The talk will start shortly afterwards.

Since we didn't get to raffle off much stuff at our booth at SCALE, we'll be
doing some raffles during the next few meetings.  We will draw for the raffle
before and after the talk.  You will get a raffle ticket just for showing up.
You may earn extra raffle tickets for audience participation.
