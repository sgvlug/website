Dr. Sam Coleman will share his experiences with the Raspberry Pi.

**TOPIC**

The raspberry pi computer has become one of the most versatile computer
platforms in the world. However few people truly understand what can be done
with this $35 single board computer. In this presentation I'll share with you
a few of the projects that I have put together using this inexpensive ARM
based computer. The presentation will conclude with a brief Q and A session.
