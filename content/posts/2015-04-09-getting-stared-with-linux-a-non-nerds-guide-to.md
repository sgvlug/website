Dan Buthusiem will help you get an idea of what Linux is, and how to get
started with it in a totally non-committal way. Learn how to use Linux the
same way you would use your computer of choice to do non-nerd things, like
email, along with a few potentially nerdy things along the way.

Recommended Materials:

*  1 laptop

*  1 empty USB drive of at least 4 GB (8 or more preferred)

**Speaker:** Dan Buthusiem
