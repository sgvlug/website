The wonderful folks at OpenX are hosting this meeting, and they are also
providing pizza. We need to provide a list of names to building security.
RSVPs will be capped at 60. Contact Lan if you have questions.

Also, the [Southern California Linux Expo](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/16x) 
is a month away. We'll talk about what to expect and where we need help.

**TOPIC**

Open source is vital towards our future in technology development and is being
promoted across government institutions and within the private sector. In this
talk he will cover the who, what, where, why, and how's of open source based
on his life experience. This talk will seek to inform and recruit the audience
to engage and contribute in open source by providing answers to the simple
questions. Together we will discuss lowering the barrier to entry into the
open source world. And if you're already contributing to open source then we
will share life experiences and camaraderie and plans to infect more people
with the open source bug.
