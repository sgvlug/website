Please RSVP no later than August 18th.  Some Google scripting magic automatically updates the form with how many people are expected and what people say they are bringing. 

Upon submission of RSVP, you will be directed to a confirmation page with directions to Lan's house, as well as contact info.
You can submit an updated RSVP at any time.  Lan regularly updates the spreadsheet back-end to keep things accurate and will contact you if you have questions.
