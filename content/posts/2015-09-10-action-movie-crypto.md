This month, long-time SGVLUG member Dustin Laurence reprises his [SCALE 13x
talk](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x/presentations/action-movie-
crypto).   We'll also be talking about the SGVLUG BBQ for September, the 20th
anniversary party plans for November, and SCALE 14x.

**Abstract:**
  
The details of how cryptographic algorithms are designed, implemented,
verified, and assembled into cryptosystems requires expert knowledge.
Fortunately, the big picture of how the resulting cryptosystems are used does
not. For most users and even most programmers, the underlying algorithms are
black boxes that they do not and need not understand, while the language and
conceptual framework of modern cryptography are very useful in putting those
algorithms to practical use.

We will sketch out that conceptual framework at action-movie speed using the
simplest of classical cryptographic algorithms to represent the modern black
boxes for concreteness while studing everything but the algorithms themselves.
After the presentation you should understand: elementary cryptographic
language, security as a probabalistic rather than absolute guarantee, why the
size of the keyspace matters, why practical security depends on choosing keys
randomly, what side-channel attacks are, what public-key cryptography is, and
what a digital signature is. You should also have the basic conceptual
framework and vocabulary for further study or self-study. The presentation
should be accessible to beginners of all ages.

**Biography:**

Intending to become a programmer ("developer" hadn't been invented by the
marketing department yet), Dustin got sidetracked and spent more time than he
cares to admit doing theoretical physics, a background filled with continuous
mathematics almost entirely irrelevant to computer science and cryptography.
He eventually returned to his original love, and these days writes
cryptographic and embedded software for Gem, Inc. He believes that every
programmer and indeed every citizen must be cryptographically literate in the
world he and many, many others are busy creating. He avoids social media for
the same reason he doesn't do crack cocaine.
