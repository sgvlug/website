AROS is an open source re-implementation of Amiga OS 3.1. This year with the Directory Opus 5 bounty, the ABI V1 on-trunk merge and the release of Icaros v2, that will be covered, it has been a very significant year for the project.

Simone Bernacchia is a web developer with a background as graphic artist and musician on a couple of Amiga games. He also has a blog where he writes about retro Amiga games, protracker music composing and AROS.
