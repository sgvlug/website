**Abstract:**

The Raspberry Pi has become a favorite of Amateur Radio operators world-wide.
Although most of the development on projects is occurring outside of the
United States, there are a significant number of products and hacks available.
Repeater controllers, VOIP servers, and even turning your Pi into a
transceiver is possible and is being done.
