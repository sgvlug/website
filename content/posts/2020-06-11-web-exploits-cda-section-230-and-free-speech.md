**Why saving Section 230 is crucial to protecting free speech online**

By Jess Bermudes

In recent years, people from all areas of the political sphere have sought to curb the protections provided to online platform operators by Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, including most recently a congressional bill that would have hampered end-to-end encryption and an executive order by President Trump to investigate and draft legislation to repeal the act itself. This is a mistake that will severely inhibit free speech online. We'll talk about the history of legislation in this area, common misconceptions about these Internet laws and what we can do to protect a free and open Internet.

**Agenda:**

6:45 - Introductions, chat

7:05 - Announcements.

7:15 - Talk starts
