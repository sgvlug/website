Title: February 2005 Meeting
meetingdate: 2005-02-10

Mark Echeverri, who has years of experience in traditional software and
systems engineering, says: "For the past couple of months, I've been working
with Plone. It's an impressive system, and not exactly something you pick up
in a Saturday. Previously, I had never done any Web-related development; Plone
is a Zope tool that allows you to juggle Web portals like bowling
pins...provided you know how to take advantage of it. Quite powerful."

About Zope and Plone:

"Zope is an open source application server for building content management
systems, intranets, portals, and custom applications....Zope is written in
Python, a highly-productive, object-oriented scripting language."

"Plone is an out-of-the-box ready content management system that is built on
the powerful and free Zope Application server. It requires minimal effort to
set up, is deeply flexible, and provides you with a system for managing web
content that is ideal for project groups, communities and intranets."
