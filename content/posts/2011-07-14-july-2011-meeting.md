APRS is a amateur radio network where small packets of data such as position   
reports, messages or telemetry are transmitted to other radio operators and    
eventually propagated to the Internet.

The proliferation of small, low power and easily hackable ARM devices opens up 
many possibilities for setting up unobtrusive computing solutions. Amateur     
radio operator and long time Linux user James McDuffie (K6JLM) explores using  
the Seagate GoFlex Net along with surplus amateur radio equipment to build a   
APRS digipeater for helping to relay packets both over RF and to the Internet.
