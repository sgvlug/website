Join us for our monthly LUG meeting, featuring some very interesting shell data
tools written by this month's speaker, Dima Kogan.

The UNIX shell is a useful environment to get work done. There're a number of
standard, simple tools that talk to each other via a universal interface: the
pipeline. This talk focuses on methods to manipulate and visualize data
directly in the shell, without moving to specialized environments (numpy,
matlab, etc). Specifically I will demonstrate and describe

* *feedgnuplot* - a tool plot data coming in on STDIN
* *vnlog* - a toolkit to read, write and manipulate columnar ASCII data

These are independent tools that are useful standalone, but with shell
piping are EXTRA useful together and in conjunction with other standard
UNIX tools. This unification of data processing and normal shell usage
enable powerful workflows that are otherwise unavailable.

*SPEAKER*

Dima Kogan - Robotics Engineer, Jet Propulsion Laboratory

Dima is a long-time user and contributor to various Free Software projects. He
lives in the shell inside Emacs on his Debian box, and is constantly looking
for ways to save keystrokes. He plays with robotics tools during the day, and
tries to give away as much of his work as possible.
