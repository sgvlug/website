**The Young Man and the C Reloaded**

What if I told you that most or all nontrivial C and C++ programs you have ever
written were just illusions? Most such programs contain undefined behavior, and
undefined behavior is at the heart of most C and C++ security problems, yet few
programmers understand how far down that rabbit hole goes. We will swallow the
red pill and study the nature and extent of undefined behavior in C and C++,
techniques for writing more secure, reliable C and C++ in spite of the reality
of undefined behavior and other mischief, and little-used compiler flags and
other tools to detect and/or eliminate bugs.


**Dustin Laurence Bio**

Intending to become a programmer ("developer" hadn't been invented by
the marketing department yet), Dustin got sidetracked and spent more
time than he cares to admit doing theoretical physics, a background
filled with continuous mathematics almost entirely irrelevant to
computer science. He eventually returned to his original love of, and
though they probably won't admit it currently hacks code for Whitemoon
Dreams, Inc.  He avoids social media for the same reason he doesn't do
crack cocaine.
