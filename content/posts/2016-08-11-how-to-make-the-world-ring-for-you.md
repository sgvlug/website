**Abstract**:

What do amateur radio operators, small businesses, giant corporations, E911 
systems, and Linux hobbyists all have in common?

Well, besides using Linux, they all are using an application called Asterisk, 
in one of its many forms, to handle telecommunications.

Amateur radio operators can interlink plain old telephone systems with repeaters, 
small businesses can appear to the world to be a large corporation with custom 
interactive voice response menus, and hobbyists can lower their home phone bill 
to as little as a $1.00 per month with $0.0015/minute call charges.

Not to mention to have a phone number virtually anywhere in the world termin
ate at your home,

The presentation will introduce Asterisk, its applications, basic Python scripting, 
and many other things.
