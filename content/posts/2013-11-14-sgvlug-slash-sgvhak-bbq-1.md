You and your family are cordially invited to the SGVLUG & SGVHAK potluck BBQ this Saturday, November 16th, from 1-6pm.  It will be in San Gabriel.

This is a joint effort:
+ Steven Doran is bringing bratwurts and beer.
+ Michael Starch will be in charge of grilling.
+ Lan will be providing the venue and organizing.

Please RSVP using the Google form: [http://bit.ly/17oDrvK](http://bit.ly/17oDrvK)

You will receive directions to the venue after you submit the RSVP.  You can revise your RSVP at any time.  Some Google scripting magic automatically updates the RSVP with how many people are expected and what people say they are bringing.
Obviously, the earlier you RSVP, the more accurately Lan can plan.

Hope to see you there!
