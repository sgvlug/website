This month is open mic night with three short talks.

**Claire on Hack for LA**  The two biggest levers for improving people’s lives at a scale are through technology and government. At Hack for LA, we bring together coders, designers, entrepreneurs, students, government staff, activists, and other civic-minded people to solve the LA region’s biggest challenges through technology. We are a network of people making government work for the people, by the people, in the digital age. Claire will share a brief overview of some civic-hack projects that are currently being built at Hack for LA, which she has been attending for 3 months.

Claire has many interests but there are two things she always gravitates to: community service and tech! She holds a B.S. in Public Policy and Law from the University of Southern California (Fight on!) and has experience working as an IT Project Coordinator. She is now pursing a career in software development and loves that as a new developer, she can immediately combine her love for community service and computer programming at Hack for LA. On her free time, she volunteers at various tech meetups and conferences. She aims to be part of something bigger than myself by building meaningful technologies that connect people and create communities.

**Lan on sed and regular expressions** Sed is a Linux stream editor that enables text manipulation on the command line. It makes a great introduction to regular expressions, which are used as search patterns to find or find-and-replace text.

Lan spends the majority of her working hours monitoring and troubleshooting data processing systems on Linux-based computer clusters. She has accumulated a number of tips and tricks to deal with the command line. Her arsenal includes: GNU screen, awk, sed, shell scripting, remote ssh command execution, bash command history, and a variety of system utilities

**Jess on Linux kernel boot process** Most of us don’t pay attention to the text that scrolls by during bootup, or maybe our distros hide it from us. We know we can dual boot OSes with a menu, but what else does that menu do? We’ll take a brief survey of how the Linux kernel boots, and how GRUB helps configure an appropriate environment for the kernel.

Jess is a software developer who regularly emcees the SGVLUG meetings and keeps us entertained with a fun spin on Linux in the news.
