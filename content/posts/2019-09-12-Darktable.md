**Topic**

With the ubiquity of cameras, photography is everywhere! If you'd like
to improve the looks of your photographs, post-processing is an
effective way to give your work the umph and sparkle that they are
missing. In this talk we'll cover the basics of darktable, a Free
Software application for processing raw photographs. There will be an
introduction to some photographic concepts and a tutorial covering the
basics of the must-use darktable modules.
