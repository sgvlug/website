Bring tech books and leftover conference swag to exchange with other members, or
put towards a swag pile for our SCaLE booth, if we have one. Anything that
nobody wants could be brought to Repair Cafe this weekend.

We also have a double-feature for this month's presentation, both given by new
member Sean Marquez.

**How (and Why) to Choose an Open Source License**

There is a common misconception that just because your code is public on GitHub
that it is open source, but unless there is a license in your codebase, then it
is by default copyrighted. This talk will cover an introduction to copyright,
open source, the types of open source licenses, how to go about choosing an
open source license for your project, and why should you choose to open
source your project.

**The Hitchhiker's Guide to Markdown**

Markdown is the most commonly used lightweight markup language on the internet.
However, lately it has been adopted by the technical writing community as a
solution for writing documentation. This has made a lot of people very angry and
been widely regarded as a bad move.


**BIO**

Sean Marquez graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in
design of dynamic systems, from UC Irvine. During his undergrad, he project
managed a CubeSat program where he developed a passion for space exploration. He
worked for an OEM aerospace consulting firm for over a year as an associate
mechanical design engineer. In 2015, he joined and collaborated with an online
team, performing numerical simulations & control systems design, for rLoop â€“ a
non-profit global think tank that won the innovation award for the first SpaceX
hyperloop pod competition. Sean is currently a worker-owner at Space Cooperative
Inc., involved with development and testing of smart contracts to be utilized by
the Space Decentral network, collaborating on Coral - an open source robotic
space mission to mine lunar regolith for in-situ resource utilization, and
leading efforts on the adoption of the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
  methodology.
