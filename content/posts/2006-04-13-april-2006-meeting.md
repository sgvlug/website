Title: April 2006 Meeting
meetingdate: 2006-04-13

PGP is an amazing tool for verification and encryption. However, many people   
don't fully understand it-even people who use it. This talk mostly will cover  
uses and effects of PGP. The discussion will focus on PGP and e-mail, and      
other topics will be covered as well. How cryptography works and the math      
behind it will not be covered.                                                 
                                                                             
Keysigning party                                                               
                                                                             
One of the key features of PGP is the "web of trust" that grows out of         
individuals signing each other's keys as a way of validating that the          
keyholder is indeed the "owner" of the key. We encourge you to create a key    
(if you don't already have one), post it to a public keyserver, and bring your 
"fingerprint" to the meeting for a keysigning party.
