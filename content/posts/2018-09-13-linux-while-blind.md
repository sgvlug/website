Meet us for dinner and a presentation, with dinner beginning at 7pm and presentations starting around 7:45 to 8pm.

Chime Hart will present on using Linux while blind:

I want to explain a 25-year journey of using computers while blind.
In reality, a better way of understanding would be just navigating with only keyboard-and-speech for an hour or more.

I will go over the challenges and the many joys along the way - from discovering DOS, being dragged through windows, and finally 15 years as a Linux user.

I look forward to any questions along the way
