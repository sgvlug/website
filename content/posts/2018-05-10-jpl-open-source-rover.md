Eric Junkins, a Software Systems Engineer with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will talk about the
JPL Open Source Rover.  SGVHAK is one of the beta build groups for this project, so we have lots
to discuss and show off.


**TOPIC**

The JPL Open Source Rover is an open source robotics project aimed at STEM education at the high school level. 
The robot is designed to have the same mechanical suspension and steering mechanism that the Mars rovers employ. 
This project teaches many aspects that go into robotics, with aspects in mechanical and electrical 
design/engineering, and software development. At this point we have had a few beta test groups on our build 
instructions, and after refienment of those are quickly approaching the release date. Eric will be talking 
about the project, its' background, and is hoping to get feedback from some members who have had lots of 
experience in the Open Source realm.
