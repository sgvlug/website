CinePaint is an open source software application primarily used for motion     
picture frame-by-frame retouching and dust-busting. Many films, such as Harry  
Potter and Spider-Man, use CinePaint. It was used by Flash Film Works to add   
flying arrows in The Last Samurai, work that helped them win a VES award for   
Best Supporting Effects. CinePaint is the most popular open source application 
in motion picture production.
