**ABSTRACT:**
  
The software lifecycle does not end when the developer packages their code
and makes it ready for deployment. The delivery of this code is an integral
part of shipping a product. Infrastructure orchestration and resource
configuration should follow a similar lifecycle (and process) to that of
the software delivered on it. In this talk, we will discuss how to use
Terraform and Ansible for automating your infrastructure and software
delivery.

Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-Code tool for building, managing and
versioning your infrastructure. It allows you to provision and orchestrate
your resources effectively while ensuring that all your resources
configured the way you defined in your code. We will see a practical
example of deploying a complete AWS environment using Terraform.

Ansible is an automation tool that excels at configuration management and
application deployment. We will use Ansible and AWX (the open source
version of Ansible Tower) to configure our resources, deploy
applications and perform patch management.
