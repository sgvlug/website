We will have brief talks about the [Southern California Linux Expo](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org) and about the open source projects developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Stick around to talk one-on-one with the guest speakers.

**Agenda:**
6:45pm Announcements

7:00pm Southern California Linux Expo [Call for Papers](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x/cfp) and call for volunteers

7:15pm **Michael Starch** will give a tour of the newly released F' system reference. The [F´framework](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/) was developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to make spacecraft control and embedded software simpler to design, develop, and test. F´ was released as Open Source in 2017 and has continued to grow as a project and community.

7:30pm **Lini Mestar** and interns **Victor Jimenez** and **Jack Cheng** will talk about the current work they're doing with the [JPL Open Source Rover](https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov/) at JPL. The OSR was developed by JPL summer interns as an inexpensive project for high school and college classes to exercise mechanical and electronics and software engineering. It is currently being developed by the [https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover](open source community), but the OSR has proved to be a useful robotics platform at universities and at JPL.

7:45pm **Achille Verheye** will talk about the Open Source Rover community and the work they've been doing on a complete redesign of the OSR.

8:00pm **Lan Dang** will be soliciting advice and interest in restarting work on the [SGVHAK Rover](https://bit.ly/sgvhak_rover), which was part of the pilot for the Open Source Rover, but has evolved to its own design.

8:05pm Break up into individual discussions

8:45pm Wrap up

**About Connect Week**

[Innovate Pasadena](https://www.innovatepasadena.org/) launched [Connect Week](https://www.connectpasadena.com/) as a festival of independently organized talks, workshops, and social events produced by independent organizers and hosted in venues all across Pasadena. During Connect Week we invite entrepreneurs, engineers, investors, scientists, educators, businesspeople, designers, and students to unite and celebrate the creativity and ingenuity that’s right here in our own backyard.

NOTE: The SGVLUG meetings are primarily organized on Meetup.  We have had regularly monthly meetings from July 2020 to current day, but we had not been doing a good job of keeping the website up-to-date.
