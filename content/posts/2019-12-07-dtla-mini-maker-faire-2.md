Join us at the DTLA Mini Maker Faire at the Central Library in downtown Los Angeles.

It is shaping to be a huge event with nearly a hundred makers--many of them from the San Gabriel Valley--who will be exhibiting, doing workshops, giving talks, and even performing.

There will be exhibits inside the beautiful Central Library and outside in Maguire Garden. Part of 5th Street will be closed off to support more booths.
