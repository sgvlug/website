We are going virtual this month on Google Hangouts Meet. We'll see how things go with this format. If you're new to this platform:

Please be patient, as Lan will have to approve each connection.
Please turn on video during introductions. Mute unless you're speaking.

This month's topic is informal.

Many SGVLUG members volunteer with the A/V team at the Southern California Linux Expo. Part of what we do is enable video streaming of most of the talks on YouTube. After the conference, we try to edit the daylong streams into individual videos per talk.

Vincent Wong will go over his scale-av-cutter software, which was developed this year to support this post-processing. Depending on which A/V team members are available, we may talk more about the rest of the process.

Agenda:

6:30 - Introductions, chat

7:15 - Announcements, discussion about future LUG meetings.

7:30 - Talk starts
