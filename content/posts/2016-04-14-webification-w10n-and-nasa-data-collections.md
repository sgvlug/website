**The wonderful folks at OpenX are hosting this meeting, and they are also providing pizza. We need to provide a list of names to building security. RSVPs will be capped at 50.**

  
**Topic**

In this talk, Zhangfan Xing will present webification (w10n), a data
virtualization technology that simplifies use of resources on the web
platform.

He will discuss science data challenges and share his experience on developing
open source solutions for NASA/JPL. In particular, he will use webification
for science (w10n-sci) as an example to demonstrate how one can bring together
a diverse set of data and visualize them, using modern web browser, in a rapid
and effective fashion.

He will also introduce the audience to the rich data collections available at
NASA data centers and elaborate on their potential values to web data
innovators.

**Bio**

Zhangfan Xing is a technical lead at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  For over
a decade, he has been architecting and developing Information Technology
solutions for many NASA funded mission operations and research projects. He is
specialized in search technology, data analysis, web services and their
application to mission critical information and massive scientific datasets.
His recent work on webification has lead to novel web-based applications that
have had impact on NASA's mission operations and opened doors for the creation
of advanced data access and visualization technologies. He is among the first
in realizing the potential of the Web Platform as it applies to science data.
