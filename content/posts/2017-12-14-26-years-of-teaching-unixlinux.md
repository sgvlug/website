**Abstract:**

The Unix Operating System has been around since the 1960s and has provided the
backbone for the modern "Internet."

The core of the Unix and Linux experience is the command line shell. This
powerful text based interface can be leveraged to automate tasks and solve
problems that would be too tedious to tackle.  The Born Again Shell is
available on all Unix and Linux platforms.  A clear understanding of the
features of the shell along with a basic set of commands can improve your
productivity and change the way you implement solutions to text based
problems.

  
Eric will provide an overview of how his Unix/Linux classroom has evolved over
26 years.  From the blackboard handwritten lecture in a room without computers
to modern classroom with a computer on every desk.  Through it all, the common
set of command line capabilities has remained a staple in the Unix/Linux
mindset.  sed, grep, cut, tr, and awk are tools that can be combined to
transform the simplest of users into a "Power User".

  
**Bio:**

Eric Danielson was first exposed to FORTRAN as part of a Saturday high school
program at JPL.  Before that, he hadn't been exposed to computers except for
watching his father open up a briefcase sized modem to transfer files using
the house phone handset.  The Saturday class would walk onto the JPL campus
and sit at someone's desk to log into a VAX terminal to edit, compile and run
FORTRAN77 code.

Eric has since earned a B.S. in General Engineering from Harvey Mudd College
and a M.S. in Computer Science from USC.  Eric started working at JPL as a
summer student.  At that time, he was running radiative transfer code
(FORTRAN) and supporting a science team.  After the brand new Sun Microsystem
workstations were installed in the Science Division computer lab, Eric took
some evening classes at Glendale College that included C Programing and Unix
Shell Programming.  Soon after, a co-worker and mentor at JPL encouraged Eric
to take over his teaching workload at Glendale College.  An increase in his
JPL travel schedule was making it difficult to continue teaching. Eric started
teaching BASIC Programming and FORTRAN in 1989.  He eventually took over the
Unix class and has since added the Unix/Linux System Administration class to
the Glendale College curriculum.

Eric is currently the Science Data System (SDS) System Engineer for the Multi-
angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on the Terra Earth Observing
System satellite and the Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) instrument
currently in development.

Eric enjoys tinkering with Raspberry Pis and Arduinos in the creative realm of
"Makers".  His recent projects include a portable air quality monitor and a
time-lapse camera with a Raspberry Pi.
