Lan and Roger will be giving a preview of our SCaLE 17x talk about the SGVHAK
Rover. Any feedback will be extremely helpful. We'll also be talking about
SCaLE, volunteering for SCaLE, and plans for our booth at SCaLE.

Dinner begins around 7pm and the presentation will start after most people
have received their food or 8pm, whichever comes first. Buying dinner is
optional.

**The Trouble with Rovers**

The JPL Open Source Rover is a relatively inexpensive and accessible project
for high school and college classes to exercise mechanical and electronics and
software engineering using parts that could be easily sourced from hobbyist
stores.

JPL beta-tested their build instructions at a few schools and with the SGVHAK
maker group. The ultimate goal was to refine the build instructions and grow a
community of experienced builders to help provide support once the rover
documentation and code were open sourced.

We will go over the experience of the SGVHAK maker group in building the
SGVHAK rover and being inspired to build rovers of our own design. The SGVHAK
maker group built the rover over the period of 3 months while giving JPL
significant feedback and build photos. We diverged from the original design
most significantly in the wheel design, motor selection, and software.

We were able to exhibit the SGVHAK rover at SCALE, the Caltech Science for
March, and the DTLA Mini Maker Faire. We were recently interviewed for the
Command_Line Heroes podcast. Building rovers is a never-ending process. The
SGVHAK rover itself is always under construction. We have plans to add a robot
arm, pan-tilt webcam, and maybe even lidar. Our members have already started
coming up with their own rover designs and builds. All the code and 3D printer
files are on GitHub. Come join us in our rover-building adventures.

**About Lan**

Lan Dang is an Operations Engineer with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
specializing in science data systems operations and large scale data
processing. Her contributions to open source focus on community-building and
evangelism. In her spare time, she is active in the San Gabriel Valley tech
community as a leader of the SGVLUG and its sister group, the SGVHAK hardware
hacking group, mentors new hires at work as well as local high school and
college students, and volunteers with various STEAM groups and events. She is
the volunteer coordinator for the SCALE A/V team.

**About Roger**

An active member of the San Gabriel Valley Hardware Hackers group (SGVHAK) and
member of Linux User's Group (SGVLUG) Roger is interested in many topics
around the intersection of mechanical hardware and intelligent software.
