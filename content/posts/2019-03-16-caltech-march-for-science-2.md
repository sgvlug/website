SGVHAK and Santa Susana HS will have a booth at the Caltech Science for March showcasing the rovers we built as part of the JPL Open Source Rover (beta build group. We'll also feature rovers that were inspired by the process, like Dave Flynn's Mr. Blue and Roger Cheng's Sawppy.

If you are interested in attending, please RSVP on their Eventbrite page.
