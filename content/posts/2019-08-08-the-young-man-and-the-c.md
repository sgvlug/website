**Topic**

Many good, experienced high-level language programmers do not learn C or C++
well until they suddenly need to write an FFI extension, make an emergency
patch to an existing C or C++ codebase, re-implement the bottleneck component
in the application stack in a fast language, take an attractive job with a
low-level programming component, or otherwise move from their comfortable
language of choice and swallow the Red Pill of coding closer to the machine.
If you are already a programmer, you don't need to be taught how to program,
and your google-fu is strong for looking up detailed syntax.  Instead, this
will be a crash course in leveraging skills you learned in a high-level
environment and transferring them to these low-level tools, acquiring some new
skills you simply never needed before, and a building a mental picture of
where the road to expert, idiomatic mastery lies.  We will focus on plain C
because C++ is too complex to cover well in a single talk, but much of the
material will apply directly to C++.  Perhaps surprisingly, some of  it will
even make you a better programmer in your favorite comfortable,  higher-level
language.

**Bio**

  
Some little-known facts about Dustin Laurence:

* His first exposure to computers was playing Colossal Cave  
Adventure and the bootleg Fortran IV version of Zork on his cousin's work
mainframe using a glass teletype and a modem with a cradle for the handset.

* His first good programming language was C.  He lies and pretends that C is where he learned to program because 8-bit BASIC is embarrassing.

* He once gave up trying to learn the libc low-level I/O functions from the Ultrix man pages because he thought a buffer must be some kind of abstract data type provided by the C library and he couldn't find any documentation.

* He once confidently predicted that Linux was a temporary fad that would be replaced by BSD for serious work once the Berkeley codebase was completely free.  It's probably a good thing he doesn't gamble.

* He avoids social media for the same reason he doesn't do crack cocaine.

* These days he happily hacks Python for Spring Labs.
