Title: September 2007 Meeting
meetingdate: 2007-09-13

Kerry Garrison is back to demo the new trixbox Pro product from Fonality. This 
latest incarnation uses the hybrid-hosted model developed by Fonality for      
PBXtra, but gives installers the control over the hardware and phone           
provisioning that they enjoy with trixbox CE.                                  
                                                                             
Kerry Garrison has been in the IT industry for over 20 years with positions

world of Asterisk by a friend and began installing Asterisk-based phone
