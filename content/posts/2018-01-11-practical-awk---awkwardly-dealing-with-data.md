Lan will be giving a preview of her SCaLE 16x talk on AWK. Any feedback will
be extremely helpful. We'll also be talking about SCaLE, volunteering for
SCaLE, and plans for our booth at SCaLE.

Dinner begins around 7pm and the presentation will start after most people
have received their food or 8pm, whichever comes first. Buying dinner is
optional.

**Practical AWK - AWKwardly Dealing with Data**

AWK is a text processing programming language developed at Bell Labs in the
1970s. It was originally used for data extraction and reporting. It inspired
the creation of Perl and can, for the most part, be replaced by Python. It is
still incredibly useful on the Linux command-line, both for one-liners or for
short, powerful scripts.

Most people have used AWK in one way or another, but they use it without
understanding the language. AWK syntax can seem strange. But once you
understand that it is a data-driven pattern action language where the data is
automatically parsed into predefined variables, it becomes a powerful and
intuitive tool.

This talk seeks to take the mystery out of AWK by giving a quick introduction
to the language and its features. There will be examples where it provides
functionality that a dedicated utility like grep or cut or head might not.
There will also be more complex examples where a few lines of AWK result in
useful summarization of large amounts of raw data.

AWK is a great Swiss Army knife if you spend a lot of time on the command-
line.
