SGVHAK, Repair Cafe, and the JPL Open Source Rover will have collocated booths at the DTLA Mini Maker Faire. We will be located on the lawn of Maguire Garden close to library entrance.

It is shaping to be a huge event with nearly a hundred makers--many of them from the San Gabriel Valley--who will be exhibiting, doing workshops, giving talks, and even performing.
There will be exhibits inside the beautiful Central Library and outside in Maguire Garden.

Please RSVP on Eventbrite for free tickets, whether you're coming as an attendee or to help us at our booth. They had a group registration option, so I made an SGVHAK group.
