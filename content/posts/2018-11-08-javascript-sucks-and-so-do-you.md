Join us for a humorous conversation about JavaScript sins and how to write
better code. If you enjoy these types of talks, please see Michael and Carlos
afterwards about more meetups on good software design.

**TOPIC**

JavaScript, like all computer languages, has its flaws. It at times subtly
encourages programmers to commit unabsolvable crimes against the computing
world. It drags new programmers into the abyss of bad practice with the
madness of Lisp and the folly of QuickBasic. Together we shall journey into
the darkness surrounding JavaScript and shine our light into it.

Attendees should expect to learn a bit about the downside to JavaScript and
some of the bad practices that arise. We will then improve our JavaScript code
by establishing good patterns using modern JavaScript and an understanding of
software design principles. If nothing else attendees shall be thoroughly
entertained, and all will rag on JavaScript just a wee bit.

**BIO**

Michael Starch in an Engineer. He has used JavaScript professionally for many
years, and has committed every sin in JavaScript's tomb of Evil. He has often
searched for order amongst the chaotic statements of JavaScript, and brings
his methods for your consideration. He is by no means an authority on
JavaScript, but he will step up and speak with authority anyway. You shall be
entertained.
