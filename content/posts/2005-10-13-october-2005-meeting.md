Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates (Y!PP) is a java-based persistant world RPG that has    
been quietly gaining accolades for the past three years. Come join us for our  
October meeting where intern/developer Elizabeth Fong will tell tall (and not  
so tall) tales about life in the game industry and how it relates to Linux.    
                                                                             
About the presenter: Elizabeth has been programming for nearly 10 years and    
started with linux four years ago when she began hosting sites from her home   
server. Starting this semester, she will be a freshman here at Caltech.
