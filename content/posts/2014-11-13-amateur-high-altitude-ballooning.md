This talk will cover the stories and engineering challenges faced by the Null
Space Labs High Altitude Ballooning team and how they designed, analyzed, and
flew hardware and software to survive the harsh conditions of near space.
Recent flights include CUBEX, a payload capable of live image transmission,
solar changing, power management, and position reporting, as well as the
HABEXpico flight which flew half way across the United States.
