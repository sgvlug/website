**_This month, we are hosted by [Everbridge](http://www.everbridge.com/) at their training center. Everbridge is also sponsoring food and drink. _**

**ABSTRACT:**
  
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) is a new and exciting systems programming language promising strong
typing, cost free abstractions, and fearless concurrency. Some of these hard
problems have plagued all programming languages for years. We'll talk about
why Rust helps you think about other programming languages more accurately,
why Rust helps you communicate with your team, and how you can help test some
actual Rust code every day to help the Mozilla foundation improve Firefox.
