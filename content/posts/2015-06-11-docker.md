**TOPIC**

Docker is a hot trend in today's tech community, making it easier than ever to
containerize and deploy modern, and legacy software applications.  While often
mistaken for virtualization, containers take a new, lightweight approach to
abstracting and isolating the runtime environment, dependencies and networking
required by modern software.

  
This talk will cover how to get started with Docker, best practices for
containers and example workflows for developing and deploying containers
locally and in cloud environments. After this talk you should have the
essential building blocks for building a containerized environment and
application stack.
