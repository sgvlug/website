This is half social meeting, half SGVLUG housekeeping matters.

* Share your experiences and photosfrom SCALE.
* Do we have speakers for the rest of the year?
* Pass the hat to collect money for Meetup fees and other fixed costs.
* Determine interest in organizing an SGVHAK makerspace
* Who is interested in planning the SGVLUG's 25th anniversary celebration for Nov 2020

After dinner, Lan is sponsoring 2 or 3 pies for dessert.
