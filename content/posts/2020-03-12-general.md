We will have our usual meeting. It will be at IHOP in Pasadena. Topic: a discussion of the LUG, thoughts on the future of LUG, and social time.

**Covid-19:** We thought about it, and the current (March 10) CDC recommendations are to *not* cancel events unless there is community transmission in your area. Pasadena, at this time (March 10), has one "case under investigation", which is not "community transmission".

Still, please remember:
- Do NOT come if you or someone you know is vulnerable to the disease

- Do NOT come if you or someone you know is sick, or showing flu-like symptoms

- Wash your hands regularly

- Feel FREE to skip this LUG should you choose

- Watch for other announcements, the situation might change
