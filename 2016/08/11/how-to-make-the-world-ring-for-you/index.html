    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<p>What do amateur radio operators, small businesses, giant corporations, E911 
systems, and Linux hobbyists all have in common?</p>
<p>Well, besides using Linux, they all are using an application called Asterisk, 
in one of its many forms, to handle telecommunications.</p>
<p>Amateur radio operators can interlink plain old telephone systems with repeaters, 
small businesses can appear to the world to be a large corporation with custom 
interactive voice response menus, and hobbyists can lower their home phone bill 
to as little as a $1.00 per month with $0.0015/minute call charges.</p>
<p>Not to mention to have a phone number virtually anywhere in the world termin
ate at your home,</p>
<p>The presentation will introduce Asterisk, its applications, basic Python scripting, 
and many other things.</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong>:</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Wilkinson holds a PhD in Computer Science from Durham University, one of

degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Physics as well as a 
Master of Science in Applied Mathematics. During the course of his career, he has 
worked for a “think tank” doing mathematical modeling, then the U.S. Navy, thins
