    <p><strong>This month, we are hosted by <a href="http://www.everbridge.com/">Everbridge</a> at their training center.<br />
Everbridge is also sponsoring food and drink.</strong></p>
<p>Note: The GitHub Webhooks talk with Christian Weber originally scheduled for tonight
is posponed to Dec. 8th (next LUG meetng) due to speaker illness.  We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Mike Weilgart graciously agreed to be our last-minute substitute with his well-received
"Git Foundations: Basic Concepts and Definitions," which was presented at UUASC and LOPSA-LA.</p>
<p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>Dozens of commands! Hundreds of options! Git has dumbfounded sysadmins and developers alike since its appearance in 2005. And yet, this ingenious software is among the most fantastically useful ever developed. Learn Git from the ground up and the inside out with Git Foundations Training! This talk explores Gitâ€™s internals in depth. </p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
<p>Mike Weilgart has loved maths and computers all his life. Graduating high school at the age of 13, he thereafter worked in a variety of positions including software QA, calculus teacher, and graphic design, before resolving to put his love of computers to professional use as a Linux sysadmin and trainer. Mike currently consults at a Fortune 50 company as an automation specialist, and enjoys nothing more than training people to full mastery of their tools. </p>
