    <p><strong>This month, we are hosted by </strong><a href="http://newmatter.com">New Matter</a><strong>, a new
3D printing company incubated at Idealab</strong>.<strong>  Please <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SGVTech/events/234113164/">RSVP on Meetup</a> or email 
Lan (L dot Dang at ymail dot com). We'll head out to Du-Par's Restaurant
and Bakery (214 S Lake Ave, Pasadena) around 9:15pm for a late dinner.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Dave Flynn will share his extensive experience with 3D printing from the past
4 years, as well as his motivations for designing and building his own 3D
printer.  Specifically, his experience is with the RepRap style of 3D
printers.</p>
<p>The presentation will be short as Dave much prefers answering questions.</p>
<p>We welcome the 3D printing community--whether they are experts or neophytes--
to share the things they've printed and spark a conversation about what we can
do with 3D printing, how to get started, and how 3D printing can be used for
art, home, hobby, and work.</p>
<p>Please contact Lan if you are bringing something for show and tell or want to do a lightning talk.</p>
