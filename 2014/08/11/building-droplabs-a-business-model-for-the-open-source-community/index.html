    <p>Christefano Reyes and Lee Vodra will present: <strong>Building Droplabs: A Business
Model for the Open Source Community</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Droplabs is a coworking space, classroom and makerspace in
Downtown Los Angeles. Our community is made up of members who support each
other personally and professionally in a positive environment.</p>
<p>The coworking services and developer programs we offer, like Free Coworking
Days, Coders with a Cause, Mobile Device Lab and Developer Boot Camps, were
made possible because of our love of open source and a passion for learning.</p>
<p>We'd love to see more places like Droplabs, and we're happy to talk at SGVLUG
about how others can replicate our success - and avoid or overcome the
challenges we've had over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying a space to build a location-based community  </li>
<li>Traffic and parking in Downtown Los Angeles  </li>
<li>Making decisions in a consensus-based organization  </li>
<li>Empowering members to become leaders  </li>
<li>Disrupting the coworking business model  </li>
<li>Paying the bills (rent, insurance, staff, etc.)  </li>
<li>... and still having fun!</li>
</ul>
