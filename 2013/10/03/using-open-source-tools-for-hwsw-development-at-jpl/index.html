    <p><em><font color="red">Please note that the previously advertised presentation "BIG DATA! 24 hour near real time processing and computation for the JPL Airborne Snow Observatory" is being rescheduled for another time.   Big thanks to Dmitriy and Tom for being willing to put together a presentation for us on short notice.   Cookies have been promised.</font></em></p>
<p>Tom and Dmitriy will present on how they use open source tools at JPL in their line of work.
These tools include: Raspi, GStreamer, Mercurial/Trac, Wireshark, vi, and others.</p>
<p>BIO:
Dmitriy Bekker and Thomas Werne are currently staff engineers in the Instrument Flight and GSE Software group in the Instrument Electronics and Sensors Section at JPL. They are working on FPGA-based data acquisition and processing designs for multiple prototype science instruments for ground, space, and airborne applications as well as technology development for small satellites. Their projects have been deployed to the Mojave Desert, on high altitude aircraft, at observatories, and on CubeSats.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dmitriy Bekker and Thomas Werne <br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> Thursday October 10th, 2013 @ 7 pm <br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> Caltech - Downs 107. <br/>
